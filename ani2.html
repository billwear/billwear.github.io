                            <p>In the world of modern portable devices, it may be hard to believe that merely a few decades ago the most convenient way to keep track of time was a mechanical watch. Unlike their quartz and smart siblings, mechanical watches can run without using any batteries or other electronic components.</p>
                            <p>Over the course of this article I &rsquo;ll explain the workings of the mechanism seen in the demonstration below. You can drag the device around to change your viewing angle, and you can use the slider to peek at what &rsquo;s going on inside:</p>
                            <div class="drawer_container ratio_100" id="hero"></div>
                            <div id="hero_sl0"></div>
                            <p>
                                What you see here is known as the <em>movement</em>
                                – the inner part of a mechanical watch that &rsquo;s usually enclosed in a metal case. In this article I &rsquo;m focusing on a watch movement itself, since beautiful watch cases merely hide the intricate mechanisms which are the real stars of the show.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The entire watch movement has a lot of parts, and in this blog post I &rsquo;ll explain the purpose of each one. The world of watchmaking is jargon-heavy, so many of the components may have unfamiliar names, but you shouldn &rsquo;t feel pressured to remember them – the names and parts will be 
                                <span class="color_red">

                                </span>
                                for easy reference.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a functioning watch many parts are in constant motion. By default all animations in this article are 
                                <span id="global_animate_on">
                                    enabled, but if you find them distracting, or if you want to save power, you can <a href="#" class="link_button" onclick="global_animate(false);return false;">globally pause</a>
                                    all the following demonstrations.
                                </span>
                                <span id="global_animate_off" class="hidden">
                                    disabled, but if you prefer to have things moving as you read you can <a href="#" class="link_button" onclick="global_animate(true);return false;">globally unpause</a>
                                    them and have animations running.
                                </span>
                            </p>
                            <p>While the entire watch movement has many parts, the timekeeping system, which forms the core function of any watch, consists of just seven major elements which we can lay out in a straight line:</p>
                            <div class="drawer_container ratio_40" id="hero_movement"></div>
                            <p>
                                It may not look like much, but these parts still have a lot of interesting details about them that contribute to the

                                rotating at a correct pace. We &rsquo;ll start exploring these details by focusing on the source of power for this entire contraption.

                                Purely mechanical devices have a few different ways to power themselves, but one of the simplest methods to store energy is to use a spring. Most springs we see in daily life are <em>coil</em>
                                springs. In the demonstration below, you can move the

                                attached to this type of

                                to see it bounce:

                            <div id="coil_spring_sl0" class="slider_red"></div>
                            <p>
                                When a

                                like this is compressed, it stores some energy that is then released when the compressing tension is removed. Mechanical watches typically use a different kind of spring – a spiral <em>torsion</em>
                                spring. This type of 
                                <span class="color_yellow">

                                is loaded when it &rsquo;s twisted. When let go, the

                                unwinds in the opposite direction to eventually settle in its natural state:

                            <p>
                                In a mechanical watch, we ultimately want to show rotating hands, so a spinning motion that a torsion spring provides is particularly useful. A

                                you can try to wind it midair, but as soon as you let go, it will snap back to its original shape:

                                is held tight and the

                                , just like in the demonstration above. Before we finish up with the

                                , let &rsquo;s discuss two other details that make this mechanism more reliable. Let me bring up the relaxed spring one more time:
                            </p>
                            <div class="drawer_container ratio_100" id="mainspring_s2"></div>

                            <p>
                                The

                                    <strong>metal strip</strong>
                                </span>
                                attached to the

                                    <strong>mainspring</strong>

                                provides additional tension to its outer part. That

                                    <strong>metal strip</strong>
                                </span>
                                really wants to snap back to its straight shape, so it pushes against the wall of the

                                    <strong>barrel</strong>
                                </span>
                                , creating a lot of friction that keeps the mainspring in place:
                            </p>
                            <div class="drawer_container ratio_100" id="mainspring_friction"></div>
                            <p>
                                This locks the outer end of the 
                                <span class="color_gray">
                                    <strong>mainspring</strong>
                                </span>
                                when the

                                    <strong>arbor</strong>
                                </span>
                                moves the inner. If we were to keep winding the 
                                <span class="color_gray">
                                    <strong>spring</strong>
                                </span>
                                past its maximum capacity, we &rsquo;d overpower that friction letting the 
                                <span class="color_gray">
                                    <strong>mainspring</strong>

                                slip inside – this acts as a safety mechanism to prevent the parts from breaking.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As we &rsquo;ve seen, in its relaxed state, the

                                    <strong>mainspring</strong>

                                forms an S-shape with varied curvature throughout. This helps to balance the tension in 
                                <span class="color_gray">
                                    <strong>mainspring &rsquo;s</strong>

                                different sections when it is inside the

                                . Notice that the inner sections of the wound spring have a much smaller radius than the outer parts. If the relaxed spring was just a straight piece of metal, then after winding, the inner parts would be bent much more than the outer parts. With the S-shaped spring the outer sections of the spring are also under a similar tension because they want to get back to their curve that is bent in the opposite direction.

                                and prevent dust from getting in we close the

                                with a lid that snaps into its place:

                            <p>
                                We &rsquo;ve managed to make some parts rotate and one could naively think that we could just attach a 
                                <span class="color_hand">
                                    <strong>watch hand</strong>

                                to make it track time. Unfortunately, that won &rsquo;t really work – you can witness this in the demonstration below. You can see how this &ldquo;watch &rdquo;behaves after you wind the

                                with the slider and let it go:

                                If we wanted our watch to run continuously for around 40 hours on a single wind, we &rsquo;d need the minute hand to complete 40 rotations in that time. Moreover, the second hand should cover around 40 × 60 = 2400 complete rotations in that time. We need to find a way to convert a small number of revolutions of the

                                on this blog before, so let me just recap things very briefly. Gears can be used to change the speed of rotation between two different axes. In the demonstration below, you can witness that by observing little dots I put on each gear – the

                                An important aspect of two matching gears is their number of teeth. Each tooth in one gear meets with a space between teeth in the other gear, so within a unit of time both gears rotate by the same number of teeth. If the number of teeth in two gears is different, those gears can take a different amount of time to complete a single rotation. In the demonstration below, you can change the <em>ratio</em>
                                of the number of teeth between the driving

                                . We can use this behavior to make the second hand of a watch rotate many times on a single rotation of the barrel.

                            <p>Let &rsquo;s consider how much of a speed increase we have to do here. The barrel can rotate close to 7 times on a single wind, but we want the second hand to complete around 2400 revolutions in the same time. We need the ratio of teeth, or the ratio of radii, to be around 343:1. Let &rsquo;s see how that would look in practice. In the demonstration below, you can use the slider to look at the two gears from further away:</p>

                                would have to be absolutely tiny and both gears would have to have very fragile, microscopic teeth.

                            <p>
                                Instead, mechanical watches use a <em>train</em>
                                of gears with multiple gears working in pairs – each pair increases the speed to some extent. In the demonstration below, you can see the four wheels participating in this reduction. Notice that there are two gears on most axes of rotation. You can control the speed of rotation of this gear train using the slider:

                                , which drives the

                                . Notice that each big gear drives a smaller gear called a <em>pinion</em>
                                . A pinion is mounted on the same shaft as the next big gear so we &rsquo;re able to keep increasing the speed on each axis. This approach has significant advantages – we &rsquo;re able to make the overall mechanism much smaller and we &rsquo;ll soon use one of the intermediate wheels that rotates at a slower rate to drive minute and hour hands.

                                Before we finish up with gears, let me quickly mention the shape of their teeth. While many bigger machines use an <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/gears/#strings-attached">involute shape</a>
                                for the profile of their gear teeth, mechanical watches commonly use <em>cycloidal</em>
                                profiles which are obtained by <a href="https://www.tec-science.com/mechanical-power-transmission/cycloidal-gear/geometry-of-cycloidal-gears/">rolling a circle on the surface of another circle</a>
                                .

                                comes in – it forms the beating heart of a watch.

                            <p>Let &rsquo;s bring up the first torsion spring we saw before – recall that once you twist it from its original position, it will oscillate back and forth, only to settle after a while:</p>

                            <p>
                                We can control the rate of this periodic motion by adjusting two parameters. The first one is the <em>stiffness</em>
                                of the spring, which primarily depends on its height, thickness, and length, as well as the type of material from which it &rsquo;s made. The second one is the mass and its distribution, or, more precisely, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia">moment of inertia</a>
                                of the object that the spring rotates. Moment of inertia increases when more mass is put further away from the axis of rotation. In the demonstration below, you can tweak both the

                                of the spring and

                                of the attached mass to see how these parameters affect the period of rotation:

                                By carefully tuning these parameters, we can make this system oscillate at a desired rate. This idea of using a torsion spring with attached mass is exactly what mechanical watches use as their source of precise time tracking. The balance is formed by the

                                is jolted around:

                                When the watch is shaken, the motion of the

                                , similarly to the suspension system in a car. If the jerk is very strong, then the much thicker and stronger part of

                                carries the load through the

                                Let &rsquo;s attach the entire balance assembly to the rest of the movement we &rsquo;ve built so far. Notice that the other end of the

                                With that last step, we &rsquo;ve actually finished recreating the core of the watch mechanism that we &rsquo;ve previously seen floating in the air. However, you may remember that I &rsquo;ve glanced over the little detail of how to make sure that the

                                also prevents the mainspring from unwinding on its own – that &rsquo;s why you can &rsquo;t drag back the slider without restarting the entire simulation:

                                In our movement, the second hand is cleverly mounted on the fourth wheel of the power train since that wheel rotates once per minute with high precision. For the minute hand to turn at the correct pace, we need <em>some</em>
                                axis to rotate 60 times slower than that. Thankfully, the designers of this watch movement used an ingenious way to harness some of that speed reduction from the other gears.

                                that has each of the twelve hours marked – it actually lets us read the time that the hands are showing:

                                Time keeping is the fundamental function of every watch, but many devices go beyond that by adding various additional features known as <em>complications</em>
                                . While our movement is not very sophisticated, it still has a nice complication that shows the current day of the month right in the little window on the right side of the dial. Let &rsquo;s see how this feature is implemented.

                                snags onto a tooth on the date ring and gets flexed, but at some point it starts to push the date ring forward. When the ring rotates enough the

                                rapidly snaps the ring to the next position.

                                You may wonder why we need this complicated mechanism in the first place. One could naively assume that we could directly tie the rotation of the date ring to the rotation of the

                                , similarly to how we rotated the

                                in sync with minutes, albeit at slower pace. Unfortunately, this would cause the current date to <em>continuously</em>
                                rotate under the little window in the dial, making it hard to read. You can see that behavior on the left side in the demonstration below:
                            </p>
                            <div class="drawer_container ratio_60" id="date_flow"></div>
                            <p>On the right side you can see the date indicator as operated by the mechanism that we &rsquo;ve just built – the date only changes around midnight. You may have realized that the date tracking in our movement is not particularly smart. This watch always counts 31 days every month, so we have to change the date a day after a shorter month occurs. Moreover, if the watch hasn &rsquo;t been running for a while, the time itself may be incorrectly set. We need to find a way to adjust date and time on our watch.</p>

                                Thankfully, gears driving the minute hand, the hour hand, and the date indicator are all connected, so we can adjust everything by turning a

                                Finally, when the crown is pushed roughly halfway through, we enter date setting mode, but to see it work we still need to attach an additional

                                Personally, I think this entire mechanism known as the <em>keyless works</em>
                                is a real mechanical marvel. The intricate interactions are so well balanced and each part serves many different roles. Older pocket watches were wound by a separate key, with the crown being used only to set the time, but modern watches get away with not having a winding key, which explains the <em>keyless</em>
                                name. With just a few carefully shaped pieces and a single crown, we can control various settings of the watch. Before we move on, let &rsquo;s secure the remaining pieces with the

                            <p>When the person wearing a watch moves arms throughout the day, the orientation of that watch in space changes quite a lot. Even during a leisurely walk, the watch swings slightly relative to the ground. Normally, all the energy used to move the watch goes to waste, but an automatic winding mechanism manages to capture some of it to wind the mainspring.</p>
                            <p>
                                Let &rsquo;s first try to understand the main idea by attaching the complete automatic winding mechanism to the watch. Its primary part is the

                                as you rotate the watch in space by dragging it around. The gravity works towards the bottom of this website – it always pulls the

                                can only turn in one direction with the click preventing the mainspring from just unwinding on its own. However, the

                                can swing back and forth, which would normally imply that any gear system that is connected to that

                                so that you can see what &rsquo;s going on inside. You can rotate that

                                . Only one such pair is active at a time – the other either spins idly, or acts as an intermediate to change the direction of rotation to make sure the

                                attached to the weight, so it takes a lot of arm swinging to fully wind the mainspring. However, over the course of a day the automatic winding mechanism can usually ensure that the mainspring stays wound.

                            <p>In all the examples so far we had the comfort of looking at the parts at a fairly large magnification, but in this last demonstration down below you can finally see how tiny all the components are. By dragging the slider you can change the viewing size:</p>

                            <p>That rounded rectangle surrounding the watch corresponds to the size of a credit card – if you have one handy you can put it on screen and drag the slider until the card fits in that outline. Hopefully, this really puts in perspective how small all the parts we &rsquo;ve talked about are.</p>

                                There are many YouTube channels dedicated to mechanical watches, but I particularly like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/WristwatchRevival/videos">Wristwatch Revival</a>
                                , which is dedicated to fixing broken watches, which very often involves a complete dissection of a movement, and a repair or replacement of broken parts. Although the creator is not a professional watchmaker, the videos are packed with information and are very enjoyable to watch.

                                by George Daniels is a book dedicated to the process of actually <em>making</em>
                                watches from scratch. While few will endeavor this journey, the publication also explains many of the considerations required when designing a watch movement and its parts. Many of the book &rsquo;s pages are accompanied by pretty technical illustrations that help to explain the concepts.

                            <p>In the 1970s mechanical watches started to be dethroned by quartz models, which track time by electronically counting vibrations of a quartz crystal. As technology progressed, typical watches only increased their reliance on digital circuits. Modern smart reincarnations resemble their archetypes only in shape and placement on wrists.</p>
                            <p>
                                Mechanical watches are not as accurate as digital ones. They require maintenance and are more fragile. Despite all these drawbacks, these devices show a <em>true</em>
                                mastery of engineering. With creative use of miniature gears, levers, and springs, a mechanical watch rises from its dormant components to become truly alive.
