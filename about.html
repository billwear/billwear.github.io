<li><b>UL50</b> I've been using Unix for 50 years.</li>
<li><b>P+++</b> I've earned a living with Perl.</li>
<li><b>L(U)+++</b> I use Ubuntu Linux exclusively, mostly command line.</li>
<li><b>E+++</b> Emacs is my login shell!! M-x doctor is my psychologist! I use emacs to control my TV and toaster oven! All you vi people don't know what you're missing! I read alt.religion.emacs, alt.sex.emacs, and comp.os.emacs.</li>
<li><b>W1.0+++</b> I am an original Netizen.</li>
<li><b>N+++</b> I read so many newsgroups that the next batch of news comes in before I finish reading the last batch, and I have to read for about 2 hours straight before I'm caught up on the morning's news. Then there's the afternoon.</li>
<li><b>K+</b> I like Kibo. If you know, you know.</li>
<li><b>w---</b> Windows is bloatware.</li>
<li><b>V</b> I've used VMS. Meh.</li>

<li><b>Y+</b> I have an interest and concern in privacy issues, but in reality I am not really all that active or vocal.</li>
<li><b>PGP++</b> I have the most recent version and use it regularly.</li>
<li><b>t+++</b> Star Trek inspires me. I wonder about about warp field dynamics and the principles behind the transporter. I have owned the TECH manual and the LP record. I speak some Klingon. I wear an IDIC. I still hate the LCARS interface, though, it really sucks.</li>
<li><b>5</b> Babylon 6 is sub-par.</li>
<li><b>X-</b> It's ok if you like paranoia and conspiracy stories.</li>
<li><b>R+++</b> I've built and run my own dungeons for money. Lots of money. At comic-cons. With 100 little envelopes of dice I brought with me.</li>
<li><b>tv---</b> Not much on TV anymore, though I sometimes watch it when I'm petting the cat.</li>
<li><b>b++</b> I find the time to get through at least one new book a month.</li>
<li><b>D---</b> Dilbert doesn't speak to me; I've tried to stay out of those type situations.</li>
<li><b>xkcd</b> I check out xkcd from time to time; sometimes it's really funny.</li>
<li><b>G</b> I know what the geek code is and even did up this code.</li>
<li><b>e++++</b> I am well-educated, mostly by myself, but I did get more than one college degree.</li>
<li><b>h+++</b> I live in the swampy woods, on land I own, in a house I own outright, and try to live as self-sufficiently as possible.</li>
<li><b>r+++</b> I found my angel, and we've been married for decades now.</li>
