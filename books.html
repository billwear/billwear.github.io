      <!-- Book 1 content -->
      <article>
      <center></center><h2>Book 1 · Getting Things Done</h2>
    <p class="lead">Translation, not transformation: externalize intuition into visible next actions — in tolerable chunks.</p></center>
     <ul class="takeaways">
          <li><strong>You’re not broken; the environment changed.</strong> Your brain was built for berries and tigers, not Jira and Slack. That’s why you feel scattered—and why there’s a sane way through it.</li>

          <li><strong>One pipe for everything.</strong> Stop inventing a new hack for every mess. Work, home, ideas—run it all through a single, trusted flow and the chaos starts organizing itself.</li>

          <li><strong>Make your imagination work on command.</strong> You already “see” finished things in your head. This turns that daydream into a repeatable sequence you can start anytime.</li>

          <li><strong>Build a cockpit, not a shrine.</strong> A clean surface, one capture tool, lists you trust, and a small standing time slot. It’s wiring the instruments so takeoff is calm.</li>

          <li><strong>Free your RAM.</strong> The relief isn’t from finishing everything—it’s from parking everything where you know you’ll come back to it.</li>

          <li><strong>Decide, don’t stash.</strong> Stress is mostly “undecided stuff.” Clear the intake and the windshield clears with it.</li>

          <li><strong>Clear buckets kill hesitation.</strong> When everything has a home, your brain stops asking “where does this go?” and starts moving.</li>

          <li><strong>Keep lists alive with a reset.</strong> Without a simple weekly sweep, lists turn into zombies. A quick reset brings the map back to the territory.</li>

          <li><strong>Match action to the moment.</strong> No more guilt about “big rocks” at 10 pm. Use a simple filter to pick what fits the slot you’re in.</li>

          <li><strong>Name the next move and watch the fog lift.</strong> “Fix the docs” is quicksand. “Open the draft and outline sections” is traction.</li>

          <li><strong>Capture it all or second-guess it all.</strong> Trust shows up when every stray thought—from cat litter to launch plan—lands in the same net.</li>

          <li><strong>Work toward a finish line, not a feeling.</strong> “Router reset and online, lights stable” beats “work on router.” A clear end state turns drudgery into progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted"><em>If this resonates with you, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/">buy the book</a> and read it.</em></p>

      <!-- Book 2 content -->
      <article>
        <center></center><h2>Book 2 · Atomic Habits</h2>
        <p class="lead">Tiny moves, compounding over time. Identity first, outcomes second. Build an environment that makes the right thing the easy thing—and let consistency do the heavy lifting.</p></center>

        <ul class="takeaways">
          <li><strong>Win by 1%—repeated.</strong> You don’t need heroics; you need small, repeatable moves that compound into something huge.</li>

          <li><strong>Change your identity, not just your checklist.</strong> Don’t “finish a rewrite”—be the kind of writer who shows up. Habits are votes for who you are.</li>

          <li><strong>See the loop, then shape it.</strong> Every habit runs cue → craving → response → reward. Once you notice the wiring, you can edit it.</li>

          <li><strong>Spot the trigger.</strong> Most slips are autopilot. Name the cue (time, place, mood, people) and you stop flying blind.</li>

          <li><strong>Attach the new to the known.</strong> “After X, I do Y.” Habit stacking and tiny intentions make starts frictionless.</li>

          <li><strong>Let the room do the work.</strong> Good cues obvious, bad cues invisible. Design spaces that steer you without effort.</li>

          <li><strong>Real self-control is setup.</strong> Remove temptations upfront so you don’t need midnight willpower.</li>

          <li><strong>Make it feel good now.</strong> Pair habits with immediate rewards and small wins—motivation loves quick feedback.</li>

          <li><strong>Borrow a better normal.</strong> Join tribes where your target behavior is standard; culture pulls you forward.</li>

          <li><strong>Debug the need, not just the habit.</strong> Every “bad” habit solves a problem. Keep the reward, swap in a better response.</li>

          <li><strong>Show up beats speed.</strong> Never miss twice. Traction comes from consistency, not perfect days.</li>

          <li><strong>Bend the path of least resistance.</strong> Lower friction for good habits, raise it for bad ones; convenience wins every time.</li>

          <li><strong>Start in two minutes.</strong> Shrink entry points until starting is effortless—momentum will take it from there.</li>

          <li><strong>Automate your better self.</strong> Commit devices, reminders, filters—install guardrails so the system helps you behave.</li>

          <li><strong>Track what you treasure.</strong> Streaks and visible progress keep habits alive; your brain craves proof.</li>

          <li><strong>Play where you have leverage.</strong> Aim habits at your natural strengths so discipline gets a tailwind.</li>

          <li><strong>Live in the Goldilocks zone.</strong> Keep challenges “stretch but doable”—too easy bores you, too hard breaks you.</li>

          <li><strong>Refactor routines before they fossilize.</strong> Habits are a foundation, not a prison—review and refresh to keep growing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="muted"><em>If this clicks, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/">buy the book</a>—the full method lives there.</em></p>

<!-- Book 3 content -->
<article>
  <h2>Book 3 · Deep Work</h2>
  <p class="lead">Quiet intensity on purpose. Depth is rare and valuable—so you schedule it, defend it, and turn it into visible artifacts while the shallow stuff lives on a budget.</p>

  <ul class="takeaways">
    <li><strong>Depth is your leverage.</strong> In a noisy economy, the ability to focus is a competitive edge most people never train.</li>

    <li><strong>Focus doesn’t “show up”—you schedule it.</strong> If it isn’t on the calendar, shallow wins by default.</li>

    <li><strong>One target per block.</strong> Pick a single outcome for the session, remove friction (door, notifications, status), and start.</li>

    <li><strong>Choose a style that fits your life.</strong> Long retreats, weekly chunks, daily rhythms, or seize-the-moment sprints—the point is consistency, not one “right” philosophy.</li>

    <li><strong>Train boredom tolerance.</strong> The urge to switch is the muscle to train; resisting it is a rep toward deeper focus.</li>

    <li><strong>Be ruthless about inputs.</strong> Keep tools and feeds that earn their keep; quit the ones that don’t pay rent in results.</li>

    <li><strong>Drain the shallows.</strong> Batch low-value tasks, time-box them, and keep a visible budget so they don’t swallow your day.</li>

    <li><strong>Rituals are your runway.</strong> Simple start cues and a shutdown ritual protect attention and create repeatable takeoff/landing.</li>

    <li><strong>Ship proof, not vibes.</strong> End each block with an artifact—draft, commit, diagram—so progress is tangible.</li>

    <li><strong>Defend your fortress politely.</strong> Use status messages, office hours, and norms so people know when you’re heads-down.</li>

    <li><strong>Make depth the default meaning.</strong> Shallow work is necessary; deep work is satisfying. Optimize your week for the latter.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="muted"><em>If this resonates with you, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/">buy the book</a>; there's so much more there for everyone.</em></p>
