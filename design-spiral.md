# The design spiral

*Why design never runs in a straight line — and why that’s a feature, not a bug.*

---

## What it is

The **design spiral** says engineering moves in loops, not lines. You begin with rough guesses, circle back to refine them, and each pass tightens accuracy and detail. Don’t chase perfection on pass one — orbit closer with each cycle.

---

## Why it matters

- **Iterative refinement:** each cycle adds clarity — dimensions firm up, costs sharpen, risks surface.
- **Feedback built in:** early tests inform later choices, cutting expensive rework.
- **Flexibility:** evaluate trade-offs as new data arrives.

---

## How it looks in practice

1. Sketch the concept (paper, whiteboard, CAD).
2. Estimate feasibility: weight, cost, time, performance.
3. Prototype or simulate.
4. Test, measure, compare to requirements.
5. Adjust assumptions and repeat.

## Example

Ship design (classic use case):

- First spiral: length, beam, displacement, propulsion (rough).
- Second spiral: refine hull shape, stability analysis, weight balance.
- Third spiral: structure, detailed systems, safety margins.
- Final spirals: production drawings, cost checks, build plan.

## The engineer’s mindset

*The design spiral isn’t inefficiency — it’s realism. Every loop brings surprises. Expect them, capture them, and spiral toward a better answer, faster.*
