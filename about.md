# ABOUT ME

i work best when i function like an OS — not a productivity system, not a planner, not a GTD clone. i use a scheduler that matches how my mind actually runs. something that feels natural, humane, and frictionless instead of forced.

## MY HUMAN TIME-SHARING ALGORITHM

(working name: stormrider/rr)

this is a real operating model. not metaphor. not theory. not a wild hair in a stiff breeze. this runs my day.

it's built in layers.

---

### LAYER 0: THE TRUTH

i am a multi-core, interrupt-driven, round-robin mind.

i do not do one thing at a time.
i do not stick with a task until it’s done.
i naturally:

* context switch
* hop
* preempt
* juggle
* incubate
* rediscover momentum
* finish in waves


this is not a problem. this is a design feature.

everything below is about giving that native pattern structure instead of shame.

---

### LAYER 1: PROCESS CLASSES (PCs)

i don’t have “projects.” i have process classes — repeating types of work that recur across my life.

1. PC-DEV – making (solder, sew, code, tinker)

2. PC-WRITE – jotif, book, website copy

3. PC-HOUSE – renovation, fixes, errands

4. PC-LIFE – finances, docs, bills, planning

5. PC-MIND – reading, reflecting, learning

6. PC-CARE – health, rest, exercising the body

7. PC-SOCIAL – connections, convos, collaboration

that’s myvuniverse. anything i do falls into one.

i never choose the next task. i choose the class.


---

### LAYER 2: QUANTUM (Q)

my natural “quantum” — how long one core stays on a process before switching — is 20–30 minutes.

why? because:

* i warm up fast
* i lose interest right after the first insight
* i love micro-closure
* i accelerate by switching, not stagnating

so: Q = 25 minutes.

so i set a timer. when it dings: i switch processes, not tasks.

---

### LAYER 3: PROCESS QUEUES (PQs)

each process class has a ready queue:

PC-DEV
PC-WRITE
PC-HOUSE
PC-LIFE
PC-MIND
PC-CARE
PC-SOCIAL

each queue holds 1–3 active tasks.
not the whole universe. just the ones in the queue at the moment.

i do NOT pick from the entire backlog. backlog doesn't even make any sense.
i pick from the ready queue of the class i'm currently running.

this stops overwhelm instantly.

---

### LAYER 4: THE SCHEDULER LOOP (SL)

here’s the entire loop in four steps:

1. pick the next process class
round-robin across the seven classes unless energy dictates otherwise.

2. run Q = 25 minutes
deep enough to progress, short enough to avoid burnout.

3. mark one thing as “advanced”
not done. just moved forward by one step.

4. enqueue notes, switch class, repeat. no guilt. switching is progress.

the cycle takes ~3 hours to run through once. i can successfully run 1–3 cycles per day. four if things are urgent or emergent.


---

### LAYER 5: PREEMPTION RULES

i don’t stay on a process:

* when my energy drops below 40%
* if my interest snaps
* if an idea sparks for a different class
* when a real-world dependency blocks
* after Q < 25 min if stalled

preemption isn’t failure.
it’s the OS doing its job.

---

### LAYER 6: THE “DONE” MODEL

this is the piece that fixes my fear.

in stormrider/rr, “done” means: i advanced the process one quantum.
not “i finished the project.”
not “i completed the whole thing.”
not “i wrapped it with a bow.”

a process is “done for now” when the timer rings.

this removes existential pressure.
and my brain instantly calms.

---

### LAYER 7: DAILY BOOT SEQUENCE

when i wake up, you run three checks:

1. energy: high, medium, or low

2. gravity: which process class is tugging on mecemotionally

3. context: what the day demands (appointments, errands, obligations)

i combine these and select my starting class.

examples?

* energy low → PC-MIND
* gravity high on writing → PC-WRITE
* context: errands → PC-LIFE

---

### LAYER 8: WEEKLY MAINTENANCE

once per week:

* i empty each PQ into a backlog file
* choose 1–3 tasks per class for next week
* rebuild PQs clean
* archive momentum, not guilt

this is my “garbage collection” cycle.

---

### WHAT THIS SYSTEM GIVES ME

* no more half-finished shame
* no more forcing serial focus
* predictable switching
* momentum through rotation
* guilt-free preemption
* clear queues
* stable weekly rhythm
* a definition of “done” that matches my nervous system
* a way to juggle without chaos
* a way to finish things in waves, not marathons
* an OS that honors who i actually am
