# SDR with a Raspberry Pi 4
      Hook up a HackRF One, catch your first signals, then explore. No photos yet; reshoot pending.

## Hooking it up
      * **USB:** Plug the HackRF One into a Pi 4 USB port.
      * **Power:** Use a solid USB-C supply (3A or better).
      * **Antenna:** Attach an antenna to the HackRF’s SMA jack.
      * **Cooling:** Give the Pi airflow (small fan) for long sessions.
      * **Space:** Keep the antenna away from cables to reduce noise.

## First boot on the Pi
        ```lsusb | grep -i hackrf
hackrf_info```
        Run these to confirm the device is seen and responding.

## What it feels like
      When the spectrum waterfall opens, it’s like a window: bright spikes, shimmering bands, hidden voices everywhere.
