<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Understanding how MAAS components work together is essential before
diving into configuration details.</li>

<li>MAAS operates on a distributed architecture where region controllers
manage the global state and API, while rack controllers handle local
network services and hardware communication.</li>

<li>This separation allows MAAS to scale from single-rack deployments to
large multi-datacenter environments.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org05d02ac" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org05d02ac"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.1.</span> Component communication patterns</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MAAS uses a hub-and-spoke architecture where region controllers act
as the central coordination point for all rack controllers in the
environment.</li>

<li>Communication flows through well-defined REST API calls and event
messaging systems that ensure consistent state management across the
entire infrastructure.</li>

<li>Region-to-rack communication happens primarily through the MAAS
event system, where the region controller publishes configuration
changes, deployment requests, and management commands.</li>

<li>Rack controllers maintain persistent connections to monitor for
these events and respond accordingly.</li>

<li>This includes network configuration updates, machine deployment
instructions, and power management commands.</li>

<li>Rack-to-region communication occurs when rack controllers report
machine status updates, hardware discovery results, or service
health information back to the central database.</li>

<li>This includes DHCP lease notifications, power management results,
commissioning script outputs, and hardware inventory data collected
during machine discovery.</li>

<li>The communication pattern ensures that rack controllers can operate
semi-autonomously during network partitions, queuing events and
synchronizing when connectivity returns.</li>

<li>This design provides resilience in distributed environments where
network reliability may vary between datacenters or rack locations.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org0358318" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0358318"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.2.</span> Data flow between region and rack controllers</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Data flows in MAAS follow predictable patterns that optimize both
performance and reliability.</li>

<li>The region controller maintains the authoritative database and
serves as the source of truth for all configuration and state
information, while rack controllers cache necessary data locally to
minimize latency for time-sensitive operations.</li>

<li>Configuration data flows from region to rack controllers whenever
network settings, machine assignments, or service configurations
change.</li>

<li>This includes DHCP reservations, DNS zone updates, and boot image
synchronization.</li>

<li>Rack controllers receive these updates through the event system and
apply changes to their local services automatically.</li>

<li>Hardware and status data flows from rack controllers back to the
region, providing real-time updates on machine states, network
connectivity, and service health.</li>

<li>This bidirectional flow ensures that the web UI and API always
reflect current system status while allowing rack controllers to
operate independently when needed.</li>

<li>Boot and deployment data follows a hybrid pattern where rack
controllers serve boot images and installation files directly to
machines, but coordinate the deployment process through the region
controller.</li>

<li>This approach minimizes network traffic to the region while
maintaining centralized orchestration of complex deployment
workflows.</li>

<h4 id="orgc6d3baf"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.3.</span> High availability and clustering considerations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MAAS supports high availability through both region controller
clustering and rack controller redundancy.</li>

<li>Region controllers can operate in active-active clusters sharing a
common PostgreSQL database, while multiple rack controllers can
serve the same network segments for redundancy and load
distribution.</li>

<li>Region controller clustering requires a shared PostgreSQL database
that all region controllers can access.</li>

<li>Each region controller runs the full API and web interface, allowing
load balancers to distribute requests across multiple instances.</li>

<li>Database consistency is maintained through PostgreSQL's built-in
replication and locking mechanisms.</li>

<li>Rack controller redundancy works by having multiple rack controllers
manage the same VLANs and subnets.</li>

<li>MAAS automatically coordinates DHCP service assignments to prevent
conflicts, typically designating one rack as primary and others as
secondaries for each network segment.</li>

<li>If the primary rack fails, secondary racks can take over DHCP
services automatically.</li>

<li>Failure scenarios and recovery are handled differently depending on
the component involved.</li>

<li>Region controller failures affect API availability and web UI access
but don't interrupt ongoing deployments or local network services.</li>

<li>Rack controller failures impact local services but don't affect the
global MAAS state or other rack controllers.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MAAS network topology must accommodate both management traffic
between controllers and the diverse networking needs of managed
machines.</li>

<li>Region controllers need reliable connectivity to rack controllers
and the PostgreSQL database, while rack controllers need access to
all machine networks they manage.</li>

<li>Region controller networking requires connectivity to all rack
controllers, typically over standard IP networks.</li>

<li>These connections carry API traffic, event messages, and file
transfers for boot images and deployment artifacts.</li>

<li>Region controllers don't need direct access to machine networks,
allowing them to be placed in secure management networks.</li>

<li>Rack controller networking is more complex, requiring connectivity
to both the region controllers and all VLANs containing managed
machines.</li>

<li>Rack controllers must be able to provide DHCP, DNS, and PXE boot
services to machines, which often means having interfaces on
multiple network segments or using DHCP relay configurations.</li>

<li>Machine network access varies depending on the deployment phase.</li>

<li>During commissioning and deployment, machines need access to rack
controller services and image repositories.</li>

<li>After deployment, network requirements depend on the specific
workload and operational needs, but machines typically don't need
direct access to MAAS controllers.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Region controllers maintain the central PostgreSQL database that
stores all MAAS configuration, machine inventory, and operational
state.</li>

<li>This includes machine hardware specifications, network
configurations, user accounts, image repositories, and the complete
history of machine lifecycle events.</li>

<li>Machine inventory management encompasses the complete hardware
profile of every machine under MAAS control.</li>

<li>This includes CPU specifications, memory configuration, storage
devices with SMART data, network interfaces with MAC addresses, and
any specialized hardware like GPUs or storage controllers.</li>

<li>Region controllers track this information from initial discovery
through the entire machine lifecycle.</li>

<li>Configuration and policy enforcement happens at the region
controller level, where global settings like network configurations,
deployment options, and security policies are defined and
distributed to rack controllers.</li>

<li>This includes DNS and DHCP configurations, boot image selections,
commissioning script assignments, and user access controls.</li>

<li>Image repository management involves maintaining the collection of

<li>Schema design and data modeling in MAAS reflects the complex
relationships between physical hardware, network configurations, and
logical constructs like resource pools and availability zones.</li>

<li>The database schema evolves with MAAS versions, and region
controllers handle schema migrations automatically during upgrades.</li>

<li>API endpoint architecture provides RESTful access to all MAAS
functionality, with endpoints organized around logical resource
types like machines, networks, images, and users.</li>

<li>The API supports both synchronous operations for immediate actions
and asynchronous operations for long-running tasks like machine
deployments.</li>

<li>The MAAS web interface provides a graphical way to interact with all
MAAS functionality, from basic machine management to complex network
configuration.</li>

<li>The interface is built as a single-page application that
communicates with the backend API, ensuring that UI capabilities
stay in sync with API features.</li>

<li>Single sign-on integration options allow MAAS to integrate with
existing identity management systems through protocols like SAML,
OpenID Connect, or LDAP.</li>

<li>This integration enables users to access MAAS using their existing
corporate credentials while maintaining proper audit trails and
access controls.</li>

<li>Role-based access control implementation in the web UI reflects the
permission model defined in the database, showing or hiding
interface elements based on user roles and resource access rights.</li>

<li>Users see only the machines, networks, and operations they're
authorized to access, with the UI adapting dynamically to their
permission levels.</li>

on during commissioning, deployment, and ongoing operations.</li>

<li>These services must be highly available and performant since they're
in the critical path for machine lifecycle operations and can affect
entire network segments if they fail.</li>

<li>DHCP lease management and reservations involves running ISC DHCP
servers that provide IP addresses to machines during PXE boot and
installation processes.</li>

<li>Rack controllers coordinate DHCP configurations to prevent conflicts
when multiple racks serve the same network segments, typically using
primary/secondary configurations with automatic failover.</li>

<li>DNS zone delegation and updates allows rack controllers to serve
authoritative DNS zones for managed machines, providing both forward
and reverse DNS resolution.</li>

<li>This includes automatically updating DNS records when machines are
deployed or network configurations change, ensuring that hostname
resolution stays current with actual machine assignments.</li>

<li>NTP service synchronization ensures that all managed machines
maintain accurate time synchronization, which is critical for
security protocols, log correlation, and distributed application

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The network boot process is fundamental to how MAAS manages
machines, requiring careful coordination between DHCP, DNS, and PXE
boot services.</li>

<li>Rack controllers must handle these services reliably since any
failures can prevent machines from commissioning or deploying
successfully.</li>

<li>PXE boot sequence and timing involves a complex handshake between
machines, DHCP servers, and TFTP services.</li>

<li>When a machine boots from the network, it first requests an IP
address via DHCP, receives boot server information in the DHCP
response, then downloads boot files via TFTP.</li>

<li>Rack controllers must respond quickly at each step to prevent boot
timeouts.</li>

<li>TFTP service configuration requires careful attention to file
permissions, network timeouts, and concurrent connection limits.</li>

<li>TFTP is an inherently unreliable protocol, so rack controllers
implement retry logic and connection pooling to handle the high
connection volumes that occur during mass machine deployments.</li>

<li>Boot image serving and caching involves storing and serving the
kernel and initrd files that machines download during network boot.</li>
