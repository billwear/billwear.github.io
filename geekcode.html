    <li>
      <strong>
	GE
      </strong>
      Geek of Engineering.
    </li>
<li><strong>d-*</strong>x I’m usually in jeans and a t-shirt.</li>
<li><strong>s:++</strong> I’m of average height, I’m a linebacker candidate.</li>
<li><strong>a+++</strong> age 60 and up (65 atm).</li>
<li><strong>C++++</strong> I’ll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface
installed into my skull.</li>
<li><strong>UL50</strong> I’ve been using Unix for 50 years (on Jun 14, 2024).</li>
<li><strong>P+++</strong> I’ve earned a living with Perl.</li>
<li><strong>L(U)+++</strong> I use Ubuntu Linux exclusively, mostly command line.</li>
<li><strong>E+++</strong> Emacs is my login shell!! M-x doctor is my psychologist! I
use emacs to control my TV and toaster oven! All you vi people don’t
know what you’re missing! I read alt.religion.emacs, alt.sex.emacs,
and comp.os.emacs.</li>
<li><strong>W1.0+++</strong> I am an original Netizen, first logging on in 1994.</li>
<li><strong>N+++</strong> I read so many newsgroups that the next batch of news comes
in before I finish reading the last batch, and I have to read for
about 2 hours straight before I’m caught up on the morning’s news.
Then there’s the afternoon.</li>
<li><strong>K+</strong> I like Kibo. If you know, you know.</li>
<li><strong>w—</strong> Windows is bloatware.</li>
<li><strong>V</strong> I’ve used VMS. Meh.</li>
<li><strong>PS+</strong> My whole concept of politics? Nobody has the right to
legislate morality.</li>
<li><strong>PE</strong> Distrust both government and business.</li>
<li><strong>f—</strong> In matters of religion, I distrust all human claims for the
one true way.</li>
<li><strong>c+++</strong> I am a cyberpunk all the way, including music.</li>
<li><strong>Y+</strong> I have an interest and concern in privacy issues, but in
reality I am not really all that active or vocal.</li>
<li><strong>PGP++</strong> I have the most recent version and use it regularly.</li>
<li><strong>t+++</strong> Star Trek inspires me. I wonder about about warp field
dynamics and the principles behind the transporter. I have owned the
TECH manual and the LP record. I speak some Klingon. I wear an IDIC.
I still hate the LCARS interface, though: incredibly noisy, and it
really sucks.</li>
<li><strong>5</strong> Babylon 5 is sub-par.</li>
<li><strong>X-Files</strong> It’s ok if you like paranoia and conspiracy stories. I
don’t.</li>
<li><strong>R+++</strong> I’ve built and run my own dungeons for money. Lots of money.
At comic-cons. With 100 little envelopes of dice I brought with me.</li>
<li><strong>tv—</strong> Not much on TV anymore, though I sometimes watch it when
I’m petting the cat.</li>
<li><strong>b++</strong> I find the time to get through at least one new book a month.</li>
<li><strong>D—</strong> Dilbert doesn’t speak to me; I’ve tried to stay out of those
type situations.</li>
<li><strong>xkcd</strong> I check out xkcd from time to time; sometimes it’s really
funny.</li>
<li><strong>G</strong> I know what the geek code is and even did up this code.</li>
<li><strong>e++++</strong> I am well-educated, mostly by myself, but I did get more
than one college degree.</li>
<li><strong>h+++</strong> I live in the swampy woods, on land I own, in a house I own
outright, and try to live as self-sufficiently as possible.</li>
<li><strong>r+++</strong> I found my angel, and we’ve been married for decades now.</li>
