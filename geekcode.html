<h2>Translation</h2>

<ul>
<li>**GE** Geek of Engineering.</li>
<li>**d-** I'm usually in jeans and a t-shirt.</li>
<li>**s:++** I'm of average height, I'm a linebacker candidate.</li>
<li>**a+++** age 60 and up (65 atm).</li>
<li>**C++++** I'll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface installed into my skull.</li>
<li>**UL50** I've been using Unix for 50 years (on Jun 14, 2024).</li>
<li>**P+++** I've earned a living with Perl.</li>
<li>**L(U)+++** I use Ubuntu Linux exclusively, mostly command line.</li>
<li>**E+++** Emacs is my login shell!! M-x doctor is my psychologist! I use emacs to control my TV and toaster oven! All you vi people don't know what you're missing! I read alt.religion.emacs, alt.sex.emacs, and comp.os.emacs.</li>
<li>**W1.0+++** I am an original Netizen, first logging on in 1994.</li>
<li>**N+++** I read so many newsgroups that the next batch of news comes in before I finish reading the last batch, and I have to read for about 2 hours straight before I'm caught up on the morning's news. Then there's the afternoon.</li>
<li>**K+** I like Kibo. If you know, you know.</li>
<li>**w---** Windows is bloatware.</li>
<li>**V** I've used VMS. Meh.</li>
<li>**PS+** My whole concept of politics? Nobody has the right to legislate morality.</li>
<li>**PE** Distrust both government and business.</li>
<li>**f---** In matters of religion, I distrust all human claims for the one true way.</li>
<li>**c+++** I am a cyberpunk all the way, including music.</li>
<li>**Y+** I have an interest and concern in privacy issues, but in reality I am not really all that active or vocal.</li>
<li>**PGP++** I have the most recent version and use it regularly.</li>
<li>**t+++** Star Trek inspires me. I wonder about about warp field dynamics and the principles behind the transporter. I have owned the TECH manual and the LP record. I speak some Klingon. I wear an IDIC. I still hate the LCARS interface, though: incredibly noisy, and it really sucks.</li>
<li>**5** Babylon 5 is sub-par.</li>
<li>**X-** It's ok if you like paranoia and conspiracy stories. I don't.</li>
<li>**R+++** I've built and run my own dungeons for money. Lots of money. At comic-cons. With 100 little envelopes of dice I brought with me.</li>
<li>**tv---** Not much on TV anymore, though I sometimes watch it when I'm petting the cat.</li>
<li>**b++** I find the time to get through at least one new book a month.</li>
<li>**D---** Dilbert doesn't speak to me; I've tried to stay out of those type situations.</li>
<li>**xkcd** I check out xkcd from time to time; sometimes it's really funny.</li>
<li>**G** I know what the geek code is and even did up this code.</li>
<li>**e++++** I am well-educated, mostly by myself, but I did get more than one college degree.</li>
<li>**h+++** I live in the swampy woods, on land I own, in a house I own outright, and try to live as self-sufficiently as possible.</li>
<li>**r+++** I found my angel, and we've been married for decades now.</li>
