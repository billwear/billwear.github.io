# My EDC (every-day carry)

## Technology

* Dell 15-inch touchscreen laptop running Ubuntu — for when your café “Wi-Fi” is really just a philosophical concept.

* Power adapter — because outlets hide in corners like cryptids.

* 2 TB external drive — for those days you accidentally back up the entire Internet.

* Spare phone + charger — the one that actually rings when your main phone “dies” of embarrassment.

* Boot/reload USBs (“red pill” and “blue pill”) — for the moment a stranger says, “Windows just updated itself.”

* Northern Europe power adapter — every coworking space eventually becomes an embassy.

## Outdoor living (urban edition)

* Trail soup (4 packs) & food tabs — for nights when DoorDash loses your building.

* Electrolyte tablets — to survive open-plan offices with broken air conditioning.

* Water filter straws (2) — for apartment tap water that tastes like optimism and copper.

* Collapsible 2 L bottle and bowl — ideal for BYO ramen at 3 AM server cutovers.

* Camping spork and table knife — because office kitchens never have utensils, just spoons with trauma.

* Roll of quarters ($10) — laundromats, payphones, or convincing vending machines that you’re old-school legit.

* Compact camp shower + poncho — one for protest days, the other for “surprise” building evacuations.

* Spare shirt, socks, and hair ties — for spontaneous overnighters or moral triage in the airport bathroom.

* Large tarp + rope + carabiners — emergency shade at the company picnic or privacy on the redeye floor.

* Hatchet multi-tool — opens coconuts, fixes furniture, or ends HR conversations politely.

* Paracord + matches + fire tube — for re-lighting office morale or roasting marshmallows at a blackout.

* Backup flint sets — redundancy is love, and fire is Wi-Fi for the soul.

## Emergency

* Compact first-aid kit — paper cuts from bureaucracy count.

* Crank/solar emergency radio:

* AM/FM/Weather — for when your ISP calls “planned maintenance.”

* Large flashlight — doubles as “conversation ender” in dark parking garages.

* Solar panel &  hand crank — workout and hope generator.

* Rechargeable batteries with USB out — because everything eventually needs a reboot.
              
## Field tools (city mode)

* Twine + duct tape — for fixing reality when IT can’t.

* Rite-in-the-Rain pens + notebook — jot down revelations during power outages or dull meetings.

* Mini binoculars + compass — spying on parking signs that lie.

* 6 ft tape measure — to confirm that “tiny house” is code for “glorified hallway.”

* **Largest Swiss (with pouch):** for IKEA hex screws, bottle caps, and unexpected fishing opportunities.

* Fire-starter cotton, mirror, knot guide, and two band-aids — for Tinder dates that escalate.

* **Large Swiss Army knife:** proof that over-preparedness can still fit in a pocket.

* **SwissCard:** TSA-approved mischief device for office emergencies.

* Two hand-powered chainsaws — you never know when a fallen branch (or metaphor) needs clearing.

* “Monkey Tools” (2) — perform 15 functions, none of which you remember when needed.

* Small multi-tools and a sharpener — because dull blades make dull stories.

## Outdoor guides (for indoor people)

* Tiny Survival Guide — doubles as bedtime reading during extended power failures.

* Plastic card sets:

* Wayfinding — when Google Maps gaslights you again.

* Primitive cooking — useful after your air fryer unionizes.

* Knots — for cables, hair, or office diplomacy.

* Shelter building — for cubicle reconstruction after layoffs.

* First aid — emotional or otherwise.

* Paracord — fashion meets function.

* Fire building — applies equally to relationships and morale.

## Why carry all this?

This bag isn’t paranoia. It’s continuity. It’s comfort when the office HVAC quits, the grid hiccups, or your train dies mid-tunnel. Everything in here has saved a day, a plan, or a reputation at least once.
