## The Impatient Visionary

I'm an idea generator. My brain works like a storm cloud—filled with concepts, innovations, and grand possibilities that flash through my mind like lightning. While most people are focused on the task in front of them, I'm seeing what’s next: the next project, the next big leap, the next transformation. I see connections where others see only loose ends, and I'm driven by what *could be*.

This is challenging for me. For all the vision and creativity, turning those ideas into reality often feels like dragging a boulder uphill. I know how to make to-do lists, and I can map out projects and build elaborate plans, but when it comes time to make those ideas *real*, I flounder.

I'm great at starting, but as momentum fades and novelty wears off, I'm easily distracted by the next shiny idea. My energy gets pulled in a new direction, and suddenly that grand vision I was working on becomes just another unfinished project, left behind in a wake of new possibilities. 

### Why is this so hard?

Translating ideas into tangible results is hard; and it’s not because I'm particilarly lazy or undisciplined. I just seems to be hard-wired for novelty. I love the start of something new. I feel good when I imagine the future: ideas are exciting; the buzz of potential is like a narcotic for me. I fall flat when anticipation becomes the reality of the grind.

I get hung up when the building phase comes along. It feels like a slog through the desert—slow, repetitive, and, frankly, boring. I'd much rather go back to brainstorming that *next big thing*. 

But I know I can do better. Who actually said, "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration?" I dunno about the split, but the general idea is spot on. There's got to be a way to push through, and I'm pretty sure Emacs and org-mode have the tools I need to regulate my efforts. I just need to work out the details.

### What I'm already good at

I've already developed skills that make achievement possible; I just need to make it probable:

1. Big-picture thinking: I'm good at seeing the whole chessboard. I can map out the future, identify key opportunities, and connect the dots where others can’t. I'm a decent innovator.

2. Project breakdown: I'm pretty good at recognizing things that can't be done in one step. I know how to break down projects into "next actions." Whether it’s jotting down tasks in a notebook or using org-mode to organize your thoughts, I grok the mechanics of planning.

3. Starting strong: When a new idea grabs me, I'm all in -- for a while. I start fast and big, with contagious enthusiasm. That’s pretty rare, so I need to use it to my advantage.

4. Planning: I've got more experience with list-making, goal-setting, and outlining than anything else. The challenge isn’t in the plan; it’s in the follow-through. I need to build on this natural ability to organize by adding systems that make sticking *with* the plans easier.

### Where things break down

Long-term follow-through is my kryptonite: 

1. Waning enthusiasm: Once the excitement fades, the grind begins. When the enthusiasm dips, it’s hard to keep pushing forward.

2. Overthinking: As a visionary, I'm constantly refining ideas, and it's paralyzing. I second-guess decisions, tweak the plan endlessly, and before Iknow it, the project stalls because I've overcomplicated things.

3. Shiny object syndrome: I'm halfway through a project -- that's being generous -- and a brilliant new idea pops into my head. It’s exciting, fresh, and full of potential. So I start working on that instead. The cycle repeats, and soon I've got a dozen half-finished projects but nothing complete.

4. Avoiding tedium: There’s always a part of every project that feels boring. For someone who thrives on big ideas, these smaller, repetitive tasks feel like torture. But they’re necessary to the project’s success, and avoiding them only delays my progress, which is more torture.

So I've set up the problem nicely; now I need to figure out how to solve it. And it's like a series of nesting dolls. I've got the idea, but now I need to do the math. Oh, lordie.
