<h1 class="title">my credo</h1>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b><b>Start small and build a little at a time</b></b>; a mosaic is more beautiful than the finest concrete, and way less likely to get you sued for improper construction.</li>

<li><b><b>Say what you mean</b></b>; because telepathy is still in beta testing.</li>

<li><b><b>Network</b></b>; because who else will laugh at your "I'm not a robot" jokes?</li>

<li><b><b>Divide and conquer</b></b>; because life is essentially a giant game of strategy board games.</li>

<li><b><b>Keep it simple</b></b>; complex plans involve running, and who's got the energy for that?</li>

<li><b><b>Do one thing well</b></b>; remember, unicorns are famous for just one horn.</li>

<li><b><b>Be who you are</b></b>; even a bent wire can carry a great light, especially in a modern art exhibit.</li>

<li><b><b>Build for strength, not just speed</b></b>; the tortoise won the race, but the hare had more Instagram followers.</li>

<li><b><b>Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention</b></b>; otherwise, you'll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just asked for the time.</li>

<li><b><b>Underpromise and overdeliver</b></b>; because everyone loves a surprise, especially when it's not another birthday card.</li>

<li><b><b>Practice the Prime Directive</b></b>; unless you're in a sci-fi movie, then totally ignore it.</li>

<li><b><b>Hack</b></b>; just remember, "try it and see" doesn't apply to skydiving or lion taming.</li>

<li><b><b>Use what you have</b></b>; unless it's a floppy disk, then maybe it's time to upgrade.</li>

<li><b><b>Use levers, not people</b></b>; because people are terrible at being levers, they keep asking for coffee breaks.</li>

<li><b><b>Release early, release often</b></b>; otherwise, you're just hoarding half-baked ideas, and there's no market for those.</li>

<li><b><b>Distrust all claims for the one true way</b></b>; except for pizza, pizza is always the answer.</li>

<li><b><b>Think ahead, but donâ€™t worship your plans</b></b>; all things are possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.</li>
