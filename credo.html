          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start small and build gradually:</strong> A mosaic is more beautiful than the finest concrete — and far less likely to get you sued for shoddy construction.</li>
            <li><strong>Say what you mean:</strong> Telepathy is still in beta testing, and the user documentation is terrible.</li>
            <li><strong>Network:</strong> Who else will appreciate your “I’m not a robot” jokes, or at least pretend to laugh?</li>
            <li><strong>Divide and conquer:</strong> Because life is essentially one long strategy board game, and yes, you are the pawn.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Complex plans involve running. Who has the stamina for that?</li>
            <li><strong>Do one thing well:</strong> Unicorns are famous for only one horn, and nobody calls them underachievers.</li>
            <li><strong>Be who you are:</strong> Even a bent wire can carry a great light — and possibly win an art prize in the process.</li>
            <li><strong>Build for strength, not just speed:</strong> The tortoise won the race. The hare just got better TikTok views.</li>
            <li><strong>Speak clearly, listen carefully:</strong> Otherwise you’ll end up in a debate on string theory when you only asked what time lunch was.</li>
            <li><strong>Underpromise and overdeliver:</strong> Everyone loves a surprise — especially when it isn’t socks for their birthday, again.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice the Prime Directive:</strong> Unless you’re in a sci-fi movie, in which case you should definitely ignore it for dramatic effect.</li>
            <li><strong>Hack:</strong> “Try it and see” is a good principle, except in skydiving, lion taming, or electrical work without gloves.</li>
            <li><strong>Use what you have:</strong> Unless it’s a floppy disk. Then you should probably just frame it as retro wall art.</li>
            <li><strong>Use levers, not people:</strong> People make lousy levers — they keep demanding coffee breaks and dental plans.</li>
            <li><strong>Release early, release often:</strong> Otherwise you’re just hoarding half-baked ideas, and there’s no collector’s market for those.</li>
            <li><strong>Distrust all claims of the one true way:</strong> Except for pizza. Pizza is always the answer.</li>
            <li><strong>Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans:</strong> Not all who wander are lost; some are just searching the couch cushions for their keys.</li>
