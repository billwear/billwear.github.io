## The Netizen's Way

**Say what you mean**; because telepathy is still in beta testing.

**Be choosy with your media**, because your brain thinks it’s real. Unless, of course, you’re watching someone paint happy little trees.

**Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention**; otherwise, you’ll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just asked for the time.

**Do what you love**; life’s too short not to ply your craft. Just don’t expect it to pay the bills, unless your craft is printing money.

**Keep it simple**; complex plans involve running, and who’s got the energy for that?

**Start small and build a little at a time**; a mosaic is more beautiful than the finest concrete, and way less likely to get you sued for improper construction.

**Network**; because who else will laugh at your “I’m not a robot” jokes?

**Be who you are**; even a bent wire can carry a great light, especially in a modern art exhibit.

**Build for strength, not just speed**; the hare may have had more Instagram followers, but the tortoise won the race.

**Hack**; just remember, “try it and see” doesn’t apply to skydiving or lion taming.

**Under-promise and over-deliver**; because everyone loves a surprise, especially when it’s not another birthday card.

**Divide and conquer**; because life is essentially a giant game of strategy board games.

**Do one thing well**; remember, unicorns are famous for just one horn.

**Use what you have**; unless it’s a floppy disk, then maybe it’s time to upgrade.

**Use levers, not people**; because people are terrible at being levers, they keep asking for coffee breaks.

**Release early, release often**; otherwise, you’re just hoarding half-baked ideas, and there’s no market for those.

**Distrust all claims for the one true way**; except for pizza, pizza is always the answer.

**Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans**; all things are possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.

**Think big: you are the universe**. And like any good universe, remember to occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just
without the big bang.

**Abhor violence in all its forms**, even contradicting others. Keep your peace, hold your tongue, and avoid turning into a debate club mascot.

**Practice the Prime Directive**; unless you’re in a sci-fi movie, then totally ignore it.

## My Geek Code

  GE d- s:++ a+++ C++++ UL+++ P+ L+++ E+++ W+++ N+++ o+ K+ w— V PS+ PE
f— c+++ Y+ PGP++ t+++ 5- X- R+++ tv++ b++ D-— xkcd G e++++ h– r+++**  

**Translation**

| code | meaning |
|------|---------|
| GE | Geek of Engineering. | |
| d- | I’m usually in jeans and a t-shirt. |
| s:++ | I’m of average height, I’m a linebacker candidate. |
| a+++ | age 60 and up (65 atm). |
| C++++ | I’ll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface installed into my skull. |
| UL50 | I’ve been using *nix, off and on, for about 50 years. |
| P+++ | I’ve earned a living with Perl. |
| L(U)+++ | I use Ubuntu Linux exclusively, mostly command line. |
| E+++ | Emacs is my login shell!! M-x doctor is my psychologist! I use emacs to control my TV and toaster oven! All you vi people don’t know what you’re missing! I read alt.religion.emacs, alt.sex.emacs, and comp.os.emacs. |
| W1.0+++ | I am an original Netizen, first logging on in 1994. |
| N+++ | I live to chat online. |
| K+ | I like Kibo. If you know, you know. |
| w— | Windows is bloatware. |
| V | I’ve used VMS. Meh. |
| PS+ | My whole concept of politics? Nobody has the right to legislate morality. |
| PE | Distrust both government and business. |
| f— | In matters of religion, I distrust all human claims for the one true way. |
| c+++ | I am a cyberpunk all the way, except the music. |
| Y+ | I have an interest and concern in privacy issues, but in reality I am not really all that active or vocal. |
| PGP++ | I have the most recent version and use it when needed. |
| t+++ | Star Trek inspires me. I wonder about about warp field dynamics and the principles behind the transporter. I have owned the TECH manual and the LP record. I speak some Klingon. I wear an IDIC. I still hate the LCARS interface, though: incredibly noisy, and it really sucks. |
| 5 | Babylon 5 is sub-par. |
| X-Files | It’s ok if you like paranoia and conspiracy stories. I don’t. |
| R+++ | I’ve built and run my own dungeons. I have a drawer full of dice of random designs. |
| tv— | Not much on TV anymore, though I sometimes watch it when I’m petting the cat. |
| b++ | I (used to) find the time to get through at least one new book a month. And I will again, when this legacy heritage home renovation is finally done. |
| D— | Dilbert doesn’t speak to me; I’ve tried to stay out of those type situations. |
| xkcd | I check out xkcd from time to time; sometimes it’s really funny. |
| G | I know what the geek code is and even did up this code. |
| e++++ | I am well-educated, mostly by myself, but I did get more than one college degree. |
| h+++ | I live in the woods, on land I own, in a house I own. |
| r+++ | I found my angel, and we’ve been married for decades now. |

## Phreak Numbers
*The number you have dialed\...*

These phone numbers all call a recording; some are leftover Bell System
intercept (error) messages. AFAIK all legal and free, but use at your own risk.
