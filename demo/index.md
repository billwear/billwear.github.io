## The Netizen's Way

**Say what you mean**; because telepathy is still in beta testing.

**Be choosy with your media**, because your brain thinks it’s real. Unless, of course, you’re watching someone paint happy little trees.

**Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention**; otherwise, you’ll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just asked for the time.

**Do what you love**; life’s too short not to ply your craft. Just don’t expect it to pay the bills, unless your craft is printing money.

**Keep it simple**; complex plans involve running, and who’s got the energy for that?

**Start small and build a little at a time**; a mosaic is more beautiful than the finest concrete, and way less likely to get you sued for improper construction.

**Network**; because who else will laugh at your “I’m not a robot” jokes?

**Be who you are**; even a bent wire can carry a great light, especially in a modern art exhibit.

**Build for strength, not just speed**; the hare may have had more Instagram followers, but the tortoise won the race.

**Hack**; just remember, “try it and see” doesn’t apply to skydiving or lion taming.

**Under-promise and over-deliver**; because everyone loves a surprise, especially when it’s not another birthday card.

**Divide and conquer**; because life is essentially a giant game of strategy board games.

**Do one thing well**; remember, unicorns are famous for just one horn.

**Use what you have**; unless it’s a floppy disk, then maybe it’s time to upgrade.

**Use levers, not people**; because people are terrible at being levers, they keep asking for coffee breaks.

**Release early, release often**; otherwise, you’re just hoarding half-baked ideas, and there’s no market for those.

**Distrust all claims for the one true way**; except for pizza, pizza is always the answer.

**Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans**; all things are possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.

**Think big: you are the universe**. And like any good universe, remember to occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just
without the big bang.

**Abhor violence in all its forms**, even contradicting others. Keep your peace, hold your tongue, and avoid turning into a debate club mascot.

**Practice the Prime Directive**; unless you’re in a sci-fi movie, then totally ignore it.

Lovely. We can hide stuff in the `<details`> element:


## Lists

This is a plain old bulleted list:

* Banana
* Paper boat
* Cucumber
* Rocket

Ordered lists look pretty much as you'd expect:

1. Goals
1. Motivations
    1. Intrinsic
    1. Extrinsic
1. Second-order effects

It's nice to visualize trees.
This is a regular unordered list with a `tree` class:

<ul class="tree"><li><p style="margin: 0;"><strong>/dev/nvme0n1p2</strong></p>

* usr                               
    * local                         
    * share                         
    * libexec                       
    * include                       
    * sbin                          
    * src                           
    * lib64                         
    * lib                           
    * bin                           
    * games                         
        * solitaire
        * snake
        * tic-tac-toe
    * media                         
* media                             
* run                               
* tmp                               

</li></ul>

## Tables

We can use regular tables that automatically adjust to the monospace grid.
They're responsive. 

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="width-min">Name</th>
    <th class="width-auto">Dimensions</th>
    <th class="width-min">Position</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Boboli Obelisk</td>
    <td>1.41m &times; 1.41m &times; 4.87m</td>
    <td>43°45'50.78"N 11°15'3.34"E</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pyramid of Khafre</td>
    <td>215.25m &times; 215.25m &times; 136.4m</td>
    <td>29°58'34"N 31°07'51"E</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note that only one column is allowed to grow.

## Forms

Here are some buttons:

<nav>
    <button>Reset</button>
    <button>Save</button>
</nav>

And inputs:

<form class="grid">
<label>First name <input type="text" placeholder="Placeholder..." /></label>
<label>Last name <input type="text" placeholder="Text goes here..." /></label>
<label>Age <input type="text" value="30" /></label>
</form>

And radio buttons:

<form class="grid">
<label><input name="radio" type="radio" /> Option #1</label>
<label><input name="radio" type="radio" /> Option #2</label>
<label><input name="radio" type="radio" /> Option #3</label>
</form>

## Grids

Add the `grid` class to a container to divide up the horizontal space evenly for the cells.
Note that it maintains the monospace, so the total width might not be 100%.
Here are six grids with increasing cell count:

<div class="grid"><input readonly value="1" /></div>
<div class="grid"><input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /></div>
<div class="grid"><input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /><input readonly value="3" /></div>
<div class="grid"><input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /><input readonly value="3" /><input readonly value="4" /></div>
<div class="grid"><input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /><input readonly value="3" /><input readonly value="4" /><input readonly value="5" /></div>
<div class="grid"><input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /><input readonly value="3" /><input readonly value="4" /><input readonly value="5" /><input readonly value="6" /></div>

If we want one cell to fill the remainder, we set `flex-grow: 1;` for that particular cell.

<div class="grid"><input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /><input readonly value="3!" style="flex-grow: 1;" /><input readonly value="4" /><input readonly value="5" /><input readonly value="6" /></div>

## ASCII Drawings

We can draw in `<pre>` tags using [box-drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters):

```
╭─────────────────╮
│ MONOSPACE ROCKS │
╰─────────────────╯
```

To have it stand out a bit more, we can wrap it in a `<figure>` tag, and why not also add a `<figcaption>`.

<figure>
<pre>
┌───────┐ ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐
│Actor 1│ │Actor 2│ │Actor 3│
└───┬───┘ └───┬───┘ └───┬───┘
    │         │         │    
    │         │  msg 1  │    
    │         │────────►│    
    │         │         │    
    │  msg 2  │         │    
    │────────►│         │    
┌───┴───┐ ┌───┴───┐ ┌───┴───┐
│Actor 1│ │Actor 2│ │Actor 3│
└───────┘ └───────┘ └───────┘</pre>
<figcaption>Example: Message passing.</figcaption>
</figure>

Let's go wild and draw a chart!

<figure><pre>
                      Things I Have

    │   █         █         █          ░
    │   █         █         █          ░
 0  └───▀─────────▀─────────▀──────────▀─────────────
      Socks     Jeans     Shirts   USB Drives
</pre></figure>

## Media

Media objects are supported, like images and video:

![A room in an old French castle (2024)](castle.jpg)

![[The Center of the Web (1914), Wikimedia](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:The_Center_of_the_Web_(1914).webm/11)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/The_Center_of_the_Web_%281914%29.webm)

They extend to the width of the page, and add appropriate padding in the bottom to maintain the monospace grid.

## Discussion

That's it for now.
I've very much enjoyed making this, pushing my CSS chops and having a lot of fun with the design.
If you like it or even decide to use it, please [let me know](https://x.com/owickstrom).

Finally, a massive shout-out to [U.S. Graphics Company](https://x.com/usgraphics) for all the inspiration.
