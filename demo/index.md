*shout out to Oskar Wickström of [the monospace web](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/) for this cool design*

## 1740968649: change

I have ambition, and I'm betting on myself.  Gonna restart networking and electronics (and ham radio) from "scratch" and blog about it. That is all.

## 1740802292: luck

So this afternoon, I was pumping gas at my favorite convenience store. As I finished, I started to go inside and buy a lottery ticket, as is my custom. This time, for some reason, I just said, "Nope. I'm gonna bet on me. I don't need a lottery prize. I don't need Tim O'Reilly to call out of the blue and offer me my dream job. I don't need some rich uncle to die and leave me a fortune. I just need me."

That’s a heck of a mindset shift. Betting on myself means I'm taking full ownership of my future instead of waiting for luck to hand it to me. Feels like a turning point — like I’m done hoping for external saviors and ready to carve out my own path.

So what’s the first step I'm  gonna take with that energy?

## 1740682679: caulk

When I was a young man, we used to say, "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."  That is to say, we adjust our expectations to the tools and techniques we have.  Today at lunch, I was caulking the last few trim pieces on our renovated kitchen, and noticing all the places in the cabinets (contracted out) that also need caulk.  Made a grudging mental note to get the ladder out at some future time, before the family reunion in April that is our house-christening, and fill up those gaps.

I'm quite sure there were other things I didn't notice because my RAS (Reticular Activating System, I think it is?) wasn't primed for it.  The tools we hold in our hand -- the mode of working we're in at the moment -- greatly affects how we percieve the world.  If we're holding a particular tool, or in a particular mood or mindset at the moment, everything centers on those emotions, concerns, and capabilities.

Makes we wonder if we should go around our house, picking up random objects, and then try to consider what we see from that perspective.  What would we learn?  What would we realize or remember?  What would we change, maybe for the better?  Something to think about.

## Whatever comes of it, I did good today

So I've had an uneven couple of weeks. Had a dressing-down from my boss, heavy responsibilities at work, my PCP reducing my anxiety meds (didn't work so well), renovation issues, a sinus infection, stacking bills due to deduction errors at work, and a painful tooth that needs a root canal. But somehow, with it all, I've stayed sane and tried to do the right thing.

Today was good. The stronger antibiotics from the dentist are doing the trick, slowly, and I have a new, non-narcotic pain med. I cut and fitted two complicated pieces of crown mold and installed them in the most inaccessible place in the house. I made really good headway on my project at work, while picking up new skills and thinking deeply about what I'm trying to accomplish with this project. And I did three perfect drawer handle installs tonight,

Who knows what may happen tomorrow?  I don't, but whatever comes of it, today I did good.

## The Netizen's Way

**Say what you mean**; because telepathy is still in beta testing.

**Be choosy with your media**, because your brain thinks it’s real. Unless, of course, you’re watching someone paint happy little trees.

**Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention**; otherwise, you’ll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just asked for the time.

**Do what you love**; life’s too short not to ply your craft. Just don’t expect it to pay the bills, unless your craft is printing money.

**Keep it simple**; complex plans involve running, and who’s got the energy for that?

**Start small and build a little at a time**; a mosaic is more beautiful than the finest concrete, and way less likely to get you sued for improper construction.

**Network**; because who else will laugh at your “I’m not a robot” jokes?

**Be who you are**; even a bent wire can carry a great light, especially in a modern art exhibit.

**Build for strength, not just speed**; the hare may have had more Instagram followers, but the tortoise won the race.

**Hack**; just remember, “try it and see” doesn’t apply to skydiving or lion taming.

**Under-promise and over-deliver**; because everyone loves a surprise, especially when it’s not another birthday card.

**Divide and conquer**; because life is essentially a giant game of strategy board games.

**Do one thing well**; remember, unicorns are famous for just one horn.

**Use what you have**; unless it’s a floppy disk, then maybe it’s time to upgrade.

**Use levers, not people**; because people are terrible at being levers, they keep asking for coffee breaks.

**Release early, release often**; otherwise, you’re just hoarding half-baked ideas, and there’s no market for those.

**Distrust all claims for the one true way**; except for pizza, pizza is always the answer.

**Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans**; all things are possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.

**Think big: you are the universe**. And like any good universe, remember to occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just
without the big bang.

**Abhor violence in all its forms**, even contradicting others. Keep your peace, hold your tongue, and avoid turning into a debate club mascot.

**Practice the Prime Directive**; unless you’re in a sci-fi movie, then totally ignore it.

**Translation**

| code | meaning |
|------|---------|
| GE | Geek of Engineering. | |
| d- | I’m usually in jeans and a t-shirt. |
| s:++ | I’m of average height, I’m a linebacker candidate. |
| a+++ | age 60 and up (65 atm). |

| P+++ | I’ve earned a living with Perl. |
| L(U)+++ | I use Ubuntu Linux exclusively, mostly command line. |
| E+++ | Emacs is my login shell!! M-x doctor is my psychologist! I use emacs to control my TV and toaster oven! All you vi people don’t know what you’re missing! I read alt.religion.emacs, alt.sex.emacs, and comp.os.emacs. |
| W1.0+++ | I am an original Netizen, first logging on in 1994. |
| N+++ | I live to chat online. |
| K+ | I like Kibo. If you know, you know. |

| t+++ | Star Trek inspires me. I wonder about about warp field dynamics and the principles behind the transporter. I have owned the TECH manual and the LP record. I speak some Klingon. I wear an IDIC. I still hate the LCARS interface, though: incredibly noisy, and it really sucks. |
| 5 | Babylon 5 is sub-par. |
| X-Files | It’s ok if you like paranoia and conspiracy stories. I don’t. |
| R+++ | I’ve built and run my own dungeons. I have a drawer full of dice of random designs. |

| b++ | I (used to) find the time to get through at least one new book a month. And I will again, when this legacy heritage home renovation is finally done. |

| xkcd | I check out xkcd from time to time; sometimes it’s really funny. |
| G | I know what the geek code is and even did up this code. |
| e++++ | I am well-educated, mostly by myself, but I did get more than one college degree. |
| h+++ | I live in the woods, on land I own, in a house I own. |
| r+++ | I found my angel, and we’ve been married for decades now. |

## The Art of Attention

*"Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention\...*

There comes a moment in life, often in the quietest of hours, when one
realizes that the world will continue on its wayward course, indifferent
to our desires or frustrations. And it is then, perhaps, that a subtle
truth begins to emerge: the only thing we truly possess, the only thing
we might, with enough care, exert some mastery over, is our mind. It is
not a realization of resignation, but rather of liberation. For if the
mind can be ordered, if it can be made still in the midst of this
restless life, then we have already discovered the key to a deeper kind
of freedom.

**Observe your thoughts**

But how does one begin? It is not with grand declarations or bold,
sweeping changes. That would miss the point entirely. Rather, it is with
a gentle attention to the present, a deliberate shift in the way we move
through the world. We begin by paying attention to what our mind
does---its wanderings, its anxieties, its compulsions. It is a garden
untended, overgrown with concerns that may not even be our own. And the
first step is simply to watch, to observe how the mind moves, without
judgment, without rush.

In this quiet observation, we begin to see patterns. The mind leaps from
one thing to another, rarely resting. It is caught in a web of habits,
most of which we never consciously chose. But, once we notice this, a
door opens. There is space, however small, between the thoughts. And in
that space, if we are patient, we can decide how to respond rather than
being dragged along by every impulse or fear. This is not about control
in the traditional sense, but about clarity. To act, not from reflex,
but from intent.

It is a simple beginning, but one of great consequence. For when we
reclaim our attention, even in this small way, we are no longer mere
passengers on the journey. We become, in a sense, our own guides.

**Continued practice**

As we grow in this practice of attention, something else becomes clear:
much of what occupies our thoughts is unnecessary. The mind is
cluttered, filled with concerns that seem urgent but, on closer
inspection, do little to serve our deeper well-being. Simplification is
not just a matter of decluttering our physical surroundings---it is a
way of thinking, of living. As we quiet the noise within, we see more
clearly what truly matters. We focus, not on everything, but on the
essentials. We pare down, not by force, but by choice.

This process of simplification is not an escape from complexity. It is,
in fact, a way of engaging with it more meaningfully. There are things
in life that are intricate, yes, but not everything needs our attention
at once. What truly requires our effort can be approached in small
steps, in manageable pieces. The mind works best when it is focused on
one thing at a time, when it is allowed to give itself fully to the task
at hand. In this way, the most complex of undertakings becomes simple,
not because it is easy, but because we have allowed it to unfold
naturally, one step after the other.

**It's a process**

It is tempting, in moments of ambition, to think that we must change
everything all at once, that the path to mastery or peace requires a
sudden, dramatic shift. But this is rarely the case. In truth, most
lasting changes come from small, deliberate actions. It is in the
repetition of these small actions, over time, that we build strength,
that we build the habits of mind that lead to deeper clarity. Just as a
mountain is climbed not in great leaps but in steady, measured steps, so
too is the mind brought into alignment by daily, patient attention to
the way we think.

That \"small action\" is simply *stating a mild preference*. As you
being to notice your thoughts, you can very simply address the ones that
seem particularly good or bad. For the good ones, just say quietly, to
yourself, in your head, \"I like having that thought.\" As to the
others? \"I don\'t like thinking this way.\" It seems trivial and
ineffective, but it is, in fact, life-changing.

**Strength and speed together**

But in this process, we must also remember something important: life is
not meant to be rushed through. It is not a race, nor is it a problem to
be solved. It is an experience to be lived, and living well requires
presence. To focus on one thing deeply, to give it your full attention,
is to experience it fully. And when we do this, something remarkable
happens. Time, which so often feels like it is slipping through our
fingers, begins to slow. Moments become rich, textured. Even the
simplest of tasks takes on a new significance when approached with care,
with attention.

This is the quiet art of living well. It does not demand that we abandon
the world, but that we engage with it more mindfully. It asks that we
slow down, that we look more closely, that we listen more carefully. For
in doing so, we discover that much of what we seek---clarity, peace,
even strength---was always within reach. It was simply waiting for us to
stop, to pay attention, and to begin again with intention.

The mind, like a garden, requires tending. It needs patience, a steady
hand, and, above all, consistency. There will be days when it seems
unruly, when old habits return, and when focus feels elusive. But these
days, too, are part of the process. Each small effort, each moment of
renewed attention, builds upon the last. Over time, these moments
accumulate, and what was once difficult becomes second nature.

And so, the journey to mastery of the mind begins not with grand
gestures but with the simplest of practices: the practice of paying
attention. Attention to the present, attention to what truly matters,
and attention to the quiet spaces in between. In this way, step by step,
thought by thought, we move closer to that elusive state of clarity, of
peace, and of freedom.
