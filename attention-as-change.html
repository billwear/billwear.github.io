  <h1>attention as change</h1>
  <p>
    Giving attention to your thoughts is all well and good, but how do you use this technique for change?  It's very western to quickly sort ideas and try to capitalize on the good ones, but this doesn't seem to work when it comes to changing your thinking.  In fact, changing thought patterns seems to involve a softer, non-intuitive technique that is (coincidentally) aligned with a shallow understanding of the brain.
  </p>
  <p>
    I use a digital signal processor as my analogy for the way the brain works.  You do something, it's a success, and a neuron gets laid down.  Next time you come to the same problem, that neuron produces 40mV or higher at the tip, and you feel encouraged to repeat the same behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every once in a while, though, this habit doesn't work well, so the path gets an inhibitor -- something that makes it harder to pass the 40mV threshold.  In effect, you learn that in certain circumstances, this technique doesn't work.  Except that sometimes, even though the inhibitor is active, the technique <em>does</em> work, so you get a small inhibitor on the inhibitor.
  </p>
  <p>
    You get the idea: Eventually there is a network of amplifiers and inhibitors associated with this behavior, and it becomes a solid habit.  The longer this <em>fabric</em> is generally successful, the harder it becomes to change.  The tl;dr for this is "old habits die hard."
  </p>
  <p>
    Except they don't, as it turns out.  I stumbled across something that works relatively quickly, no matter how ingrained the habit.  It involves monitoring your thoughts and applying honest emotion to what you discover.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a long time, I had unchecked "hero complex" thoughts.  Someone would do something I didn't like, or circumstances would lead me to a place I didn't want to be, and I would respond by imagining myself doing something heroic that proved me right and made "them" obviously wrong.  Clearly, this behavior involved a boatload of invalid assumptions about all sorts of things.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, I realized I was doing this a lot.  For some reason, I just looked at this and said, "You know, I really don't like <em>thinking</em> this way."  After a few days, I noticed that the behavior started to become less frequent.  It took a while to figure out what was happening, but over time, it became clear that expressing distaste with the <em>thinking</em> had a different effect from less specific statements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fast-forward to today, and I have found that all sorts of thought patterns can be dampened or amplified much faster by saying (honestly) either, "I don't like thinking this way," or "I like having thoughts like this."  This isn't a scientific assessment from a neuroscientist, just an observation from an armchair philosopher.
