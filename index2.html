Say what you mean. Be choosy with your media. 
Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention. Do what you love. Keep it simple. Start small and build a little at a time. Network. Be who you are. Build for strength, not just speed. Hack. Under-promise and over-deliver. Divide and conquer. Do one thing well. Use what you have. Use levers, not people. Release early, release often. 
Distrust all claims for the one true way.
Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans.
Think big. Abhor violence in all its forms.
Practice the Prime Directive.
