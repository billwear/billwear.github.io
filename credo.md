## my credo

1. **Say what you mean**; precision isn’t just for code. After all, telepathy's still in beta.

2. **Be choosy with your media**; your brain absorbs it like Emacs buffers. Unless it's Bob Ross—then it's a happy little exception.

3. **Speak clearly, listen carefully, and pay close attention**; otherwise, you'll end up learning Lisp when all you wanted was the time.

4. **Do what you love**; life's too short to follow someone else's script. Just don't expect your love for debugging to make you rich.

5. **Keep it simple**; complexity leads to dependency hell, and who needs that?

6. **Start small and build a little at a time**; like crafting the perfect `.emacs` config—incremental updates are your friend.

7. **Network**; it's not just about packets and protocols. A good network will laugh at your Emacs macros.

8. **Be who you are**; even a patchwork kernel can run a great system. Authenticity is your uptime.

9. **Build for strength, not just speed**; optimization can wait until after you’ve got something stable.

10. **Hack away**; trial and error is the mother of all knowledge. But, you know, maybe avoid `rm -rf /`.

11. **Under-promise and over-deliver**; it’s the best way to get the features merged upstream.

12. **Divide and conquer**; breaking down problems is like modular programming—much easier to debug.

13. **Do one thing well**; like Unix tools, specialize. Even if it's just editing text really, really well.

14. **Use what you have**; unless it’s a 14.4k modem—then maybe invest in an upgrade.

15. **Use levers, not people**; people aren’t tools, and tools don’t need coffee breaks.

16. **Release early, release often**; because perfection is a process, not a state.

17. **Distrust all claims for the one true way**; except maybe for `grep`. Always trust `grep`.

18. **Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans**; even the best scripts need debugging.

19. **Think big**; you’re the root user of your life. Expand your horizons but avoid kernel panics.

20. **Abhor violence in all its forms**; even in argument. There’s no `kill -9` for bad vibes.

21. **Practice the Prime Directive**; explore boldly but respect all syntax conventions.
