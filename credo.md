## my credo

1. **Say what you mean**; because telepathy is still in beta testing.

2. **Be choosy with your media**, because your brain thinks it's real. Unless, of course, you're watching someone paint happy little trees.

3. **Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention**; otherwise, you'll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just asked for the time.

4. **Do what you love; life's too short not to ply your craft**. Just don't expect it to pay the bills, unless your craft is printing money.

5. **Keep it simple**; complex plans involve running, and who's got the energy for that?

6. **Start small and build a little at a time**; a mosaic is more beautiful than the finest concrete, and way less likely to get you sued for improper construction.

7. **Network**; because who else will laugh at your "I'm not a robot" jokes?

8. **Be who you are**; even a bent wire can carry a great light, especially in a modern art exhibit.

9. **Build for strength, not just speed**; the hare may have had more Instagram followers, but the tortoise won the race.

10. **Hack**; just remember, "try it and see" doesn't apply to skydiving or lion taming.

11. **Under-promise and over-deliver**; because everyone loves a surprise, especially when it's not another birthday card.

12. **Divide and conquer**; because life is essentially a giant game of strategy board games.

13. **Do one thing well**; remember, unicorns are famous for just one horn.

14. **Use what you have**; unless it's a floppy disk, then maybe it's time to upgrade.

15. **Use levers, not people**; because people are terrible at being levers, they keep asking for coffee breaks.

16. **Release early, release often**; otherwise, you're just hoarding half-baked ideas, and there's no market for those.

17. **Distrust all claims for the one true way**; except for pizza, pizza is always the answer.

18. **Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans**; all things are possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.

19. **Think big**: you are the universe. And like any good universe, remember to occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just without the big bang.

20. **Abhor violence in all its forms**, even contradicting others. Keep your peace, hold your tongue, and avoid turning into a debate club mascot.

21. **Practice the Prime Directive**; unless you're in a sci-fi movie, then totally ignore it.
