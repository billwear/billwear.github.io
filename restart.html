let's start small, and simple. 

we experience change. moment to moment, in real time. say what you will about the nature of reality, but we detect differences.  we are not static. 

by we, i mean whatever it is that experiences change, be it one of us or many.  there is at least one consciousness. 

so there are at least three things in the void: us; change; and experience. baaed solely on these observable facts, there is observer and observation, and the change that facilitates observation.

but what is observation of change if not differentiation?
