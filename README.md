Moving my web presence to github pages. No stones thrown at my previous provider; I just want to stop spending so much on hosting.  Here's what you can find on this page ATM:

## Musings

What if many psychological issues are really just bad lessons that have become habits? Suppose I have times when I eat compulsively, or I catch myself wiggling my foot a lot? Are these really signs of a psychiatric disorder, or could it be that I learned to eat from people who routinely ate too much, and I developed a restless foot because I once had a desk that pinched my feet when I sat properly?

Emotional causes seem a little far-fetched to me a lot of the time. I have my moments, but they don't seem related to any particular driving events or moods. I can suffer huge setbacks and not react at all, and I can periods of high productivity and great results, and turn into a virtual bridge troll. The correlation just doesn't seem to be there.

### Hmm

This kinda has some implications. First, it would be really hard to think your way out of behaviours that are not driven by your state of mind, but by the habitual pathways you've laid down in your neurons. Second, pattern interrupts would only work temporarily to stop the behaviours.

It just seems extraordinarily hard to break a habit. Gotta work on this.
