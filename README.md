so i'm taking a new direction, here.

reading and writing are my whole life; journaling is a big part of that.

sadly, i haven't saved many of my old journals: they were in Unix systems that probably don't exist anymore, or on thumb drives that stopped working.

for years, i used time management as an escape, but reviewing my life, i see that journaling, for me, is pure, so i'm leaning into using a running journal to guide my life, rather than TODO lists.

i think i'll just use this site to do that; what the hell.

more to come.
