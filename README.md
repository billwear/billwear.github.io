-----

I am Bill. Here are the values I use as metrics in my life:

**Balance**: to use effort and leverage in the correct proportions.

**Proactivity**: to act when it is appropriate, rather than waiting for perfection.

**Skepticism**: to distrust claims offered without evidence.

**Flexibility**: to bravely make plans and back them up with even more courageous contingency plans.

**Ambition**: to think big, but only because I am misled by neither failure nor success.

**Peacefulness**: to choose the least violent alternative to every challenge.

**Respect**: to not think, act, or speak for others, nor advise them without imminent danger or consent.

**Mastery**: to use tools I understand to produce results worth remembering.

**Incrementalism**: to practice the art of getting better over time.

**Honesty**: to always say what I mean.

**Comnection**: to connect with other beings. 

**Strategy**: to always divide and comquer.

**Focus**: to do one thing at a time, and do it well.

**Simplicity**: to keep things relatively simple.

**Authenticity**: to be who I am by being fully present in every moment.

**Growth**: to continuously develop both strength and speed.

**Communication**: to speak clearly, listen carefully, and pay close attention all the time.

**Reliability**: to promise only what I know I can deliver.

**Acceptance**: to avoid interfering with others or making judgments about them.

**Curiosity**: to forever hack, since I believe trial and error are the only ways we learn anything.

**Sustainability**: to always preserve and use what I have, rather than buying more, when possible, because I believe that preserving the good we have *is* progress.
