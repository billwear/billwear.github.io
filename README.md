TL;DR: Is invention born of necessity or laziness, or both? Eventually, laziness, like the washing machine, becomes necessity. I've reached that point with Emacs on my phone: committed to both, so I'm determined to make it work beautifully, in small steps.

## Emacs as a universal tool
I use Emacs for lots of things, even if it's not faster. I recently learned that my employer is assigning corporate laptops this summer, giving up BYOD. This changes things for me: I don't want to put personal information on it (not even stickers). And this raises the urgency of a trivial issue.

For the longest time, Emacs was mostly confined to my laptop, with Orgzly filling the gaps on Andriod.  Now I want clean boundaries.  Yet out of hardening of the *attitudes*, I've been ducking the obvious: my phone is a powerful computer with a different interface. Time to make it my primary.

## Refusing to become brittle
My dad died twenty-some years ago, at age 73, mostly from drinking and smoking too much, but there was something else, too.  Can't remember when he said it, but as he aged, he declared that he was too old to learn new things. It was horrifying.  He was very intelligent, a teenage prodigy who made good. His attitude struck me the wrong way.

Recently, I realized that I had classified my phone as "not a fully functional computer/" I was just short of following his footsteps. Not my plan, y'all. 

## Better interfacing
Two things need to change: first, me; second, Emacs. *I* need to learn to *not* act old, instead adapting my daily life to the smaller, touchscreen interface. *Emacs* needs some customization to make it efficient on the phone. Sounds like a case for "start small and build," but I'm pretty sure I'll eventually get down to a native app that runs standalone on Android. No promises, but I can't see another endgame at this point. 

Wish me luck, and watch this space.
