Friday, at the end of a work sprint.  We call them "pulses," because sprints are live gatherings of hundreds of engineers twice a year in some exotic city, all paid for by the boss.  But, yeah, I got my two weeks' worth of work done. Still more to do, and I'll enjoy doing more later today.  A tech writer's work is never done.

## today

Today, in the margins, I'm working to develop a repeatable schedule that can become a daily habit.  I'm doing this to reduce the burden of decision-making and stress.  I have a few things I want to balance:

- On non-holiday weekdays, I have agreed to work from 9am to 6pm, with one hour for lunch.  I take this hour from 1pm-2pm, because it splits the day into two four-hour segments.

- On non-holiday weekdays, I have also agreed to work on renovating the 66-year-old home we bought in January, so that we can get moved into it, eventually.  I have established a work period of 6pm - 8:30pm, so that there is time for supper, clean-up, and relaxing before bedtime.

- On Saturdays that have nothing else scheduled, I have decided to work from 9am until 6:30pm on those same renovations.

- On Sunday, I currently have Sunday School at 10am, a worship service at 11am, choir practice at 4:30pm, and another worship service at 6pm.  The evening services are sometimes different, and at different times, based on the church's schedule of special events.

- Given that -- in general -- I am doing renovation work in the evenings and on most Saturdays, it's appropriate to schedule my shower time in the evening, after supper.

- I like to sit in my recliner and cuddle with the cat for at least one hour every night, right before bedtime.

- I have some household responsibilities, such as laundry, taking out the trash, keeping my ledger balanced, and so on.  These need to be worked into appropriate free times between these other commitments.

- I prefer to have at least one hour before work to wake up.  I keep thinking that I need more, but there is no particular reason for such.

This produces an interesting logic puzzle, which looks something like this:

This first attempt does not leave enough time for daily chores and good financial management, so I'm going to have to do it again at higher resolution.

This is as good a template as any.  Other, smaller tasks will need to be done in the unallocated time slots, but those can be handled less rigorously, for the most part.
