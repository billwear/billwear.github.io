moving my web presence to github pages. no stones thrown at my previous provider; i just want to stop spending so much on hosting.  here's what you can find on this page atm:

what if many psychological issues are really just bad lessons that have become habits? suppose i have times when i eat compulsively, or i catch myself wiggling my foot a lot? are these really signs of a psychiatric disorder, or could it be that i learned to eat from people who routinely ate too much, and i developed a restless foot because i once had a desk that pinched my feet when i sat properly?

emotional causes seem a little far-fetched to me a lot of the time.
