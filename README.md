# Undestroyable hope justified

> *I work in quiet strength, anchored in undestroyable hope justified by action, craft, and clarity.*

Depth over noise. Meaning in craft. Simplicity with soul. Signal over spectacle. Hope in motion.

Some mornings start with coffee and clarity, others with a sinus headache and existential angst.  Long ago, I gave up the dream of some open-source luminary calling me to "Come on down!"  Rescues don't work that way.

Regardless of how the day starts, there’s still this spark — this inner fire -- that refused to give up. It keeps shoving me up off the mattress, even on days when sinuses and Meniere's are tag-teaming me, when critics are taking free swings, and when Hacker News yawns at anything with heart in it.

Storms have always been my mental weather. Religion’s *false* followers promise peace, but what they’re selling isn’t the real thing — more Landru than God. I’ve learned that honesty, especially with yourself, often sounds like thunder.

Like everyone, I’m fighting to keep my resources intact while other people would happily drain them for their own satisfaction. I’ve finally given up looking for a better tool, and now I'm seeking to build something with my one, rare and valuable trait.

Undestroyable hope.

It’s the conviction that you can bootstrap your way to a life worth living without greed, without stepping on others, without lying about who you are, and without morphing into the very monsters you started the revolution to avoid.

I won't say "invincible" or "invulnerable."  My hope can be injured and pressed down by events and super-rude people whom I care about.  But it can't be destroyed; it always bounces back.

I believe I must keep going. Keep fighting. Keep stoking the fire until the fog burns off.  Spoiler: The good guys win; they always do. The trick is staying in the fight long enough to see it happen.
