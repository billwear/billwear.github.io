This is the personal website of Bill Wear. I also go by the handle "stormrider." 

I like using UNIX, Linux, emacs, and org-mode. I like to wear t-shirts and blue jeans, with all-black skateboard shoes. Sometimes I wear Columbia fishing shirts when I go out with others. 

You can learn more about me by studying my [geek](geekcode.md) and my [credo](credo.md). I live in the woods in the very deep South of the United States, in a 67-year-old house that my wife and I recently bought and are slowly renovating.

I am not impressed by distractions like social media, television, or the constant drive to "do something." I am learning, slowly, to do (deep work)[https://calnewport.com/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/].
