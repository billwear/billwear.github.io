Welcome to the personal website of Bill Wear.

I am a pragmatic existentialist, trying to live out a simple idea: *practical action creates personal meaning*. This philosophy has evolved over fifty-four years, since I began reading *[On Being a Real Person](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1572133.On_Being_a_Real_Person)* at age 9. It grew slowly as I tackled *[Walden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16902.Walden?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_6)*, then moved on to *[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629.Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_3)*, the *[Tao Te Ching](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67896.Tao_Te_Ching?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_7)*, and an extended bibliography, long since forgotten, that included Frankl, Nietzche, and a host of Zen and Quaker practioners, and some of the transient hippie philosophers of my teenage years.

It was simultaneously cemented into place through my ongoing, fifty-year, daily practice of using Unix -- and later Linux -- alongside systems such as Emacs.  In one form or another, local or remote, printed or handheld, I have depended on a Unix-like environment to help me take practical action and create personal meaning.

Along the way, observing myself, some principles have emerged as clear habits for me:

1. Start small, build incrementally. 

2. Say exactly what you mean.

3. Connect with others and build real relationships.

4. Divide and conquer to tackle larger goals.

5. Keep it simple.

6. Do one thing well at a time.

7. Be who you are.

8. Build for strength, not just speed.

9. Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention.

10. Under-promise and over-deliver.

11. Don't interfere with other people's choices unless they affect you.

12. Try lots of new things, safely.

13. Use what you have.

14. Use leverage, but not people.

15. Get it up and running quickly, then tune it.

16. Distrust all claims for the one true way.

17. Think ahead, but donâ€™t worship your plans.

18. Think as big as you can as often as you can, but understand that dreams are a vector, not a goal.
