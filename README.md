Friday, at the end of a work sprint.  We call them "pulses," because sprints are live gatherings of hundreds of engineers twice a year in some exotic city, all paid for by the boss.  But, yeah, I got my two weeks' worth of work done. Still more to do, and I'll enjoy doing more later today.  A tech writer's work is never done.
