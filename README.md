## tuesday, after lunch

why i'm in sync with emacs

Emacs is just a text editor, right? A tool for writing code, drafting documents, or taking notes. 

Hmm. 

Somehow, Emacs looms larger for me. Couldn't put my finger on it for a long time, but now I'm starting to understand. It evolved from a way of thinking, a philosophy, and a particular lifestyle. Over time, I’ve come to realize that Emacs and I are -- oddly -- kindred spirits. There's some close alignment of principle and purpose. 

**self-reliance and adaptability**

At its core, Emacs is a testament to **self-reliance and adaptability**. Unlike most software, Emacs doesn’t impose a rigid workflow on its users. Instead, it offers a flexible foundation that can be shaped and reshaped to fit any need. 

This mirrors my own life philosophy. I’ve always believed in crafting my environment to suit my goals -- whether it's my workspace, my routines, or my mental approach. This grew out of my need to thrive, growing up in chaos: a drunk father, a crazy mother, a wandering brother, and a five-year-old sister dying of leukemia, and I was the responsible one. 

Nobody to tell me how, what, or when, but a family to manage at 13. I had continually tweak my habits and surroundings to conform to the crisis-of-the-moment. It became my *de facto* workstyle. 

Just like my environment, I can quickly modify Emacs to be my perfect partner in evolving chaos. I've accepted that the universe doesn't give a flying fuck, so it's up to me to create order and meaning out of continuous churn. Emacs fits right in.

**continuous improvement and learning**

Then there’s the spirit of **continuous improvement and learning**. Emacs is never truly “done.” It’s an evolving project, built by a community that’s always seeking better ways to do things. 

This resonates. I see myself as a lifelong learner, never satisfied with the status quo, always looking for ways to refine skills and understanding. I know there's no perfect way, and I deeply distrust all claims for same. There's always a *better* way.

The joy of using Emacs isn’t just in getting things done; it’s in the process of discovery and the thrill of finding a new, better way to accomplish a task. Every time you think you've seen it all....

**community and collaboration**

Emacs also thrives on a strong sense of **community and collaboration**. It’s an open-source project, maintained and enhanced by a diverse group of contributors from all over the world. 

This community-driven spirit aligns with my belief in the power of collaboration. I’ve always felt that sharing knowledge, helping others, and building together are fundamental aspects of a fulfilling life. Every time things go sideways, I have others to pick me up and set me right, and I enjoy returning those favors.

Just as the Emacs community thrives on collective input, I find my greatest satisfaction in contributing *to* and learning *from* the communities I'm a part of.

**minimalism and efficiency**

Moreover, Emacs (kinda) champions **minimalism and efficiency**. It encourages users to do more with less, streamlining workflows to avoid unnecessary steps and distractions. 

This is in sync with my own pursuit of simplicity. I strongly believe that you should not only keep it simple, but also keep it small enough to carry with you. I’ve always sought to minimize clutter -- both physical and mental -- to focus on what truly matters. 

By reducing the extraneous, I can concentrate on my core goals and values, much like how Emacs helps me streamline my digital life to maximize productivity and satisfaction.

**legacy and flexibility**

The balance that Emacs maintains between respecting its **legacy and embracing flexibility** also speaks to me. Emacs is built on decades of development, and while it continues to evolve, it doesn’t discard the past lightly. 

This dual respect for history and adaptability is something I strive for in my own life. I deeply believe that preserving the good we have is progress. I value tradition and lessons learned from experience, but I’m not afraid to change course when needed. It’s a delicate dance -- honoring the past while staying open to new ideas and methods.

**patience and persistence**

Finally, there’s the lesson of **patience and persistence**. Mastering Emacs isn’t something that happens overnight; it takes time, effort, and a willingness to learn from mistakes. 

This echoes my own journey. I was sort of a wunderkid in school: built like a weight-lifter, smart as a whip. The same fire that burns the wood hardens the steel. As a teenager, I was the one to whip, but when bullies punched me, I just stared at them quietly. They always ran off in fear.

I know that the most meaningful achievements in life often come from sustained effort and the perseverance to keep going even when things are tough: when you're sick and tired, when you're getting knocked around, when the power company wants to cut you off and the police are delivering your 11-year-old delinquent brother and your drunk dad is puking on the porch and your mom is screaming and your little sister urgently needs an IV change -- you just deal. 

Emacs teaches patience through its complexity. It's not easy. Like real life, it wasn't intended to be easy. I’ve learned to embrace that patience and perseverance as a guiding principle in my own endeavors.

**in a mirror, darkly**

In many ways, Emacs and I are perfectly aligned. Oddly, it’s more than just a tool -- it’s a reflection of how I choose to live my life. Through adaptability, continuous learning, community, efficiency, respect for the past, and perseverance, Emacs embodies the principles that I strive to uphold every day. 

This is why I am so in sync with Emacs. It doesn’t just fit my workflow; somehow, and I *know* it sounds incredibly weird, Emacs fits my soul.
