### Life Lessons from Fifty Years of Unix Usage

***Telepathy is still in beta testing, so let's just say what we mean.***

Dive into a series that explores life through the lens of a seasoned Unix user, where simplicity rules, every command has a purpose, and life’s lessons are learned one terminal prompt at a time:

- **Media Mindfulness**: Your brain thinks what you watch is real, so choose wisely. Unless it's happy little trees—then go ahead and relax.

- **Communication Counts**: Speak clearly, listen carefully, and don't get lost in a quantum physics debate when you just asked for the time.

- **Do What You Love**: Life’s too short for anything else. But unless your craft is minting coins, don’t count on it paying the bills.

- **Keep It Simple**: Complex plans require running. Who's got the energy for that?

- **Start Small, Build Big**: Like a mosaic, small pieces create something beautiful. Plus, fewer lawsuits for improper construction.

- **Network Like a Pro**: After all, who else will appreciate your "I'm not a robot" jokes?

- **Be Yourself**: Even a bent wire can light up a room, especially in a modern art exhibit.

- **Build for the Long Haul**: The tortoise won the race, but the hare had more Instagram followers.

- **Hack Your Life**: Just remember, "try it and see" doesn't apply to skydiving or lion taming.

- **Under-Promise, Over-Deliver**: Everyone loves a surprise—just make sure it’s not another birthday card.

- **Divide and Conquer**: Life’s a giant strategy game; make your moves wisely.

- **Master Your Craft**: Unicorns are famous for just one thing.

- **Use What You Have**: Unless it's a floppy disk—then maybe it's time to upgrade.

- **Leverage Wisely**: Use levers, not people—they’re notoriously bad at being levers and keep asking for coffee breaks.

- **Release Early, Release Often**: Don't hoard half-baked ideas; there's no market for those.

- **Skepticism Saves**: Distrust all claims of the one true way—except for pizza. Pizza is always the answer.

- **Plan, But Don't Worship**: All things are possible, just don’t try skiing through a revolving door.

- **Think Big**: You are the universe; after all, the real one doesn't care. Just remember to occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions—Big Bang not recommended.

- **Keep the Peace**: Abhor violence in all its forms, even in debates. Stay calm, and don't become the debate club mascot.

- **Practice the Prime Directive**: Unless you're in a sci-fi movie—then totally ignore it.

Join me every Tuesday after lunch as we unravel the complexities of life, one line of code at a time.
