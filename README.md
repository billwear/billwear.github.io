hi. i'm bill. june 18th, 2024, marks fifty years since i started using Unix. you could say that everything i really need to know i learned from unix:

* small is beautiful.
* just the facts, ma'am.
* connect thru a simple, common language.
* take small bytes.
* simpler is better.
* do one thing well.
* accept your limitations.
* maintain balance.
* communicate clearly in both directions.
* aim for the 80% solution.
* don't work from expectations.
* try something and build from there.
* use whatever you have, do whatever you know.
* leverage is an amazing thing.
* get feedback often.
* distrust generalization.
* think ahead, but don't count on being right. 
* think big, do small.

these principles have served me well, tho sometimes my choices mystify others. 

for example, if i end up in a relationship with someone who turns out to be greedy and mean, i need to end that relationship, whatever the cost (maintain balance, don't work from expectations). i've done that more than once in my life, and although it meant some hard times for a while, i came out better in the end. 

here you can learn more about me if you're interested. i have no exorcism
expectations. enjoy.
