## The Day the Lotto Ticket Died

Some mornings start with coffee and clarity. This one started with post yard-mowing sinus disorder, a dead lotto ticket, and the creeping feeling that even the “good” tech jobs are slowly turning into franchise fast-food joints.

This morning starts with PYSD — post yard-mowing sinus disorder — the kind of fuzzy, stuffy, I’d rather dream of dusty corners than do anything useful fog that makes coffee taste like warm dirt.

Last night’s lotto ticket is a crumpled casualty on the nightstand, twenty bucks lighter in the wallet and no better at making me a millionaire than the other tickets I’ve thrown away. Somewhere in my chest there’s a long sigh about the creeping corporatization of what used to be great open-source work — the kind of thing Red Hat saw coming a decade ago, and a lot of us didn’t.

Sometimes, I dream of a luminary calling me: "Come on down!" Yeah, rescues don't work that way. No one’s coming. Nobody knows I’m here. And yet…

There’s still this spark — call it the fire of disgust, or maybe the energy of discomfort — that refuses to go out.

It keeps shoving me up off the mattress, even on days when my sinuses and inner ear are tag-teaming me, when critics are taking free swings, when Hacker News yawns at anything with heart in it.

Storms have always been my mental weather. Religion’s false followers promise peace, but what they’re selling isn’t the real thing — more Landru than God. I’ve learned that honesty, especially with yourself, often sounds like thunder.

I’m still fighting to keep my resources intact while other people would happily drain them for their own satisfaction. I’m still too quick to think a better tool will save me. I’ve nuked my Emacs, flirted with vi, stared at toolboxes like they’re treasure chests. But the truth is… it’s not the tool.

The pivot? Cal Newport got part of it right — the “rare and valuable” work, the craft that actually matters. He's monetized it well, sure, but he's also given the world something useful. We have slightly different ideas about digital minimalism, but to the same end.

Maybe that’s my turn here. Maybe I stop swapping wrenches and start building.

Because my rare value isn’t a new app or a new editor — it’s undestroyable hope.

It’s the conviction that you can bootstrap your way to a life worth living without greed, without stepping on others, without lying about who you are, and without morphing into the very monsters you started the revolution to avoid.

Coffee helps. So does writing it down. And yes — the good guys always win in the end. If I have to wear the white hat and a mask to prove it, I will.

That’s the whole game: keep going. Keep fighting. Keep stoking the fire until the fog burns off.

Yeah, the good guys do always win in the end. The trick is staying in the fight long enough to see it happen.

(If you’re reading this over your first coffee, don’t worry — no actual corporations were harmed or even intentionally targeted in the making of this post. Only the generic, nameless ones that accidentally sound like the place you work.)
