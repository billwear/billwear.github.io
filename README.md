I am Bill. Here are the values I use as metrics in my life:

1. **Balance**: to use effort and leverage in the correct proportions.

2. **Proactivity**: to act when it is appropriate, rather than waiting for perfection.

3. **Skepticism**: to distrust claims offered without evidence.

4. **Flexibility**: to bravely make plans and back them up with even more courageous contingency plans.

5. **Ambition**: to think big, but only because I am misled by neither failure nor success.

6. **Peacefulness**: to choose the least violent alternative to every challenge.

7. **Respect**: to not think, act, or speak for others, nor advise them without imminent danger or consent.

8. **Mastery**: to use tools I understand to produce results worth remembering.

9. **Incrementalism**: to practice the art of getting better over time.

10. **Honesty**: to always say what I mean.

11. **Comnection**: to connect with other beings. 

12. **Strategy**: to always divide and comquer.

13. **Focus**: to do one thing at a time, and do it well.

14. **Simplicity**: to keep things relatively simple.

15. **Authenticity**: to be who I am by being fully present in every moment.

16. **Growth**: to continuously develop both strength and speed.

17. **Communication**: to speak clearly, listen carefully, and pay close attention all the time.

18.**Reliability**: to promise only what I know I can deliver.

19. **Acceptance**: to avoid interfering with others or making judgments about them.

20. **Curiosity**: to forever hack, since I believe trial and error are the only ways we learn anything.

21. **Sustainability**: to always preserve and use what I have, rather than buying more, when possible, because I believe that preserving the good we have *is* progress.
