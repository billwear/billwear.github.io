</h1><p>Canonical has taken hits from time to time, as does anyone who takes the
risk to do something big and public. On the inside, they seriously
practice continuous improvement, always trying to get better, so there
are frequent changes. Twice yearly, we have 360-degree reviews that
indicate how others see our performance. Usually, these reviews are not
what you expect. Often, there is both positive and negative feedback.</p>
<p>So many of my friends get offended by negative feedback, frequent
corporate policy changes, and project churn. Often, if their reviews
aren’t stellar, they conclude that they should look for another job. If
their pet benefit erodes, they jump ship as fast as they can. And if
they get a manager they don’t like or can’t connect with, they quit as
fast as possible and move on to (ostensibly) greener pastures.</p>
<p>I think this can lead to job-hopping with permanent dissatisfaction. I
prefer to think differently. I wanted to share some (very anonymized)
feedback from my last review and explain how I examined that feedback,
in light of my personal values, to decide what to do next.</p>
<h2><p>how i struggle with feedback</p>
</h2><p>I should set your expectations with a warning: I try not to emotionalize
things, though it’s really hard for me. I’ve been told I have tremendous
empathy and obvious compassion. In fact, I’ve learned, for my own
sanity, to process emotional content by capturing your words and
evaluating their nuance in context, rather than reacting to tone,
nuance, and facial expressions. I try to remind myself that feedback
isn’t inherently negative or positive to me: it’s either actionable or
not. And I try very hard to implement actionable feedback only if it
conforms to my personal values.</p>
<p>In other words, I don’t see feedback as good or bad – only as something
I can do or not do. If I can do it, I then decide if it matches my
values. I may temporarily violate my values if needed, but eventually, I
will make changes to re-balance my life.</p>
<h2><p>by the way, my values</p>
</h2><p>My values are embedded in my personal credo:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Say what you mean, because telepathy is still in beta testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Be choosy with your media, because your brain thinks it’s real.
Unless, of course, you’re watching someone paint happy little trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention; otherwise,
you’ll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just
asked for the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Do what you love; life’s too short not to ply your craft. Just don’t
expect it to pay the bills, unless your craft is printing money.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it simple; complex plans involve running, and who’s got the
energy for that?</p></li>
<li><p>Start small and build a little at a time; a mosaic is more beautiful
than the finest concrete, and way less likely to get you sued for
improper construction.</p></li>
<li><p>Network; because who else will laugh at your “I’m not a robot” jokes?</p></li>
<li><p>Be who you are; even a bent wire can carry a great light, especially
in a modern art exhibit.</p></li>
<li><p>Build for strength, not just speed; the hare may have had more
Instagram followers, but the tortoise won the race.</p></li>
<li><p>Hack; just remember, “try it and see” doesn’t apply to skydiving or
lion taming.</p></li>
<li><p>Under-promise and over-deliver; because everyone loves a surprise,
especially when it’s not another birthday card.</p></li>
<li><p>Divide and conquer; because life is essentially a giant game of
strategy board games.</p></li>
<li><p>Do one thing well; remember, unicorns are famous for just one horn.</p></li>
<li><p>Use what you have; unless it’s a floppy disk, then maybe it’s time to
upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p>Use levers, not people; because people are terrible at being levers,
they keep asking for coffee breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Release early, release often; otherwise, you’re just hoarding
half-baked ideas, and there’s no market for those.</p></li>
<li><p>Distrust all claims for the one true way; except for pizza, pizza is
always the answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans; all things are possible,
except maybe skiing through a revolving door.</p></li>
<li><p>Think big: you are the universe. And like any good universe, remember
to occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just without
the big bang.</p></li>
<li><p>Abhor violence in all its forms, even contradicting others. Keep your
peace, hold your tongue, and avoid turning into a debate club mascot.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice the Prime Directive; unless you’re in a sci-fi movie, then
totally ignore it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I tried once putting nouns around each of these, and it doesn’t work out
great. For example, what noun would you assign to “be choosy with your
media” that doesn’t have pejorative connotations in modern society?</p>
<h2><p>well, what had happened was</p>
</h2><p>During this review period, I delivered some meaningful results that were
driven by my 50k-foot view. For example, I came up with a way of
expressing a product’s features in a few simple diagrams that resonated
with the product management folks. I also drafted a difficult product
model, in the process absorbing some new techniques and tools that were
completely foreign to me, kind of blazing a trail. Other than that, the
rest was the usual, mundane work that’s expected.</p>
<h2><p>Feedback and analysis</p>
</h2><p>I’m not going to share the feedback directly, since that would be really
rude, but I will allude to it in my analysis. I started with an attempt
to decide whether the various feedback elements align or diverge. It’s
not shallow thinking, but it’s not yet very deep, either:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Start small and build: People encouraged me to focus on smaller, more
concrete outcomes, and TBH, this aligns perfectly with my value of
starting small and building over time. Simplifying the scope of
everything I attempt ties into my vision of work – and life – as a
mosaic and not a magnum opus.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it simple: There were also recommendations to simplify my
approach and avoid distractions, and that’s harmonious, as well.
Emphasizing needful delivery, instead of complex new projects,
supports my drive for simplicity in plans and actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Do one thing well: Narrowing down tasks and committing to solid
deliverables mirrors my belief that it’s better to excel at one task
than to spread myself too thin. Realistic, scope-controlled targets
are consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Under-promise and over-deliver: The advice was to streamline, focus,
and resist over-committing is directly aligned.</p></li>
<li><p>Think big, but don’t worship plans: I did get lots of feedback that I
should hold onto my big-picture thinking, but not get distracted by
lofty ideas or side projects that don’t really pay off in the medium
term. This fits my idea of thinking big without being rigid.</p></li>
<li><p>Divide and conquer: Delegate and hold others accountable, they said,
and this obviously fits right in.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At first blush, there are also some potential clashes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Say what you mean: Lots of feedback encouraged me to hold team
members accountable and disagree when necessary. This is a nudge away
from my tendency to avoid contradiction. Yes, I value peace and
non-violence, and the recommendation to speak up when something is
wrong is definitely a challenge.</p></li>
<li><p>Hack and try: My instinct is to experiment and iterate, but the
feedback warns against distractions from intellectual pursuits that
don’t lead to concrete results (how would you know for sure until you
try)? This feels like it’s limiting my creating freedom to try new
things as part of the learning process.</p></li>
<li><p>Abhor violence and conflict: Enforcing accountability feels like it’s
in conflict with my desire to avoid confrontation. Holding people
accountable and objecting to disagreeable ideas feels confrontational
and uncomfortable.</p></li>
<li><p>Be who you are: There’s an underlying tension between staying true to
the big picture and the push to focus on smaller, visible wins. It
can feel like a clash with my authentic self.</p></li>
</ol>
<section id="but-am-i-living-my-values">
<h1>But am I living my values?<a class="headerlink" href="#but-am-i-living-my-values" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Let’s take a little deeper cut at this. In many ways, I’m living my
values and working hard to live life on my terms, and my work
environment is supporting this. There are also places, though, where I’m
actually not fully expressing some values – especially where those
values are in conflict. For example, “say what you mean” and “avoid
conflict” could oppose each other.</p>
<p>Is the feedback pushing me away from my values? No, not really. It’s
trying to align my thinking with the organization’s needs by focusing my
big-picture thinking on tangible outcomes, and manage the dissonance
between “tell the honest truth” and “never be assertive.” Effectively,
the feedback is nudging me to adapt in areas where I have built-in
conflicts or where I’m spinning my wheels a lot.</p>
<h3><p>meta-thinking</p>
</h3><p>Let’s take this a little deeper, maybe as deep as I can go with this at
the moment. An ideological shift I really need to consider (and not just
at work) involves reconciling some of my natural inclinations and
conflicted values with the ability to do something useful and
meaningful. I could wax on about this for paragraphs, but let me just
summarize the neonatal plan:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>From visionary to visionary practitioner: I need to integrate the
big-picture thinking with actionable results. I’ve got to accept the
fact that my strategic visions are most powerful when they lead to
real world results. I need to start more small things, but be quicker
to abandon them when they don’t seem to be getting anywhere – or at
least defer them to quieter moments.</p></li>
<li><p>Embracing simplicity as a core principle: This hurt, but it was
clearly good feedback. I’m simple in my planning, but not simply in
how I communicate, and not particularly simple in execution. I like
complexity, but I don’t have to add it where it doesn’t already
exist. This is going to require some discipline to resist adding
layers. Clarity and effectiveness, just keep saying that to myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Redefining collaboration: Clearly, I need to take accountability out
of the “war camp.” Done right, I realize that it can be an act of
mutual growth and not aggression. I have a hint that constructive
accountability doesn’t have to be confrontational. Still, there’s
some serious alignment work to do there, and it’s work that I should
do for everything else in my life as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Transform hacking into focused innovation: I’m not giving up my
hacking spirit, but I need to channel it better, into things that
align with visible and more immediate objectives. If I have to do
some things on the side to figure out what’s working, that’s okay,
but I do need to cut off the experiments a little sooner.</p></li>
<li><p>Try for assertive clarity: I don’t quite know what that means yet,
but that’s the best phrase I can think of to describe how I feel
about it. “Say what you mean” emphasizes clear communication when I
think something isn’t right – so it’s all in learning how to say it,
rather than trying not to say it. That’s gonna be hard,
uncomfortable, and unfamiliar, but worth it in the long run.</p></li>
<li><p>Balance individuality with collective goals: speaks for itself.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4><p>one level deeper</p>
</h4><p>Okay, there is another level. At it’s core, this feedback is really
pushing me to harmonize my visionary nature with pragmatic action. It’s
about recognizing that my capacity for big-picture thinking is useful
only when it regularly delivers tangible results. Though for me,
sometimes just having the picture is an accomplishment, I need to find
ways to share that picture that impacts others positively. This feedback
isn’t pushing me away from my values, but urging me to apply them in
more nuanced and meaningful way.</p>
<p>The big “life lessons” include the following personal epiphanies:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I thrive on the big picture at the expenses of details, aka, Reality
Distortion Field.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m taking my desire for peace a little farther than it will go.</p></li>
<li><p>Incremental progress is good; do it a lot more.</p></li>
<li><p>Intellectual exploration is good, but maybe not so much when there
are tasks on the line. Set aside time for it, but don’t let it
overwhelm me.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3><p>what’s it to be?</p>
</h3><p>It’s easy to have a negative emotional reaction to feedback. I have them
all the time. It’s not useful. Based on what I see here, this feedback
isn’t political, and it isn’t designed to randomize me into the
one-sigma so somebody else can get a raise. It’s honest, direct, and
relevant. As long as my colleagues keep providing this kind of advice,
I’m staying.</p>
<p>Jobs like this really are fewer and farther between. I’m 100% remote, as
are nearly all of the other employees in my company. My local job
prospects would be horrible compared to this one, and while I’m certain
I could find another remote job, why would I? The people here are smart,
honest, and thoughtful, and we work together pretty well in our teams.
No reason to walk away from that because of a little feedback that
stings.</p>
<p>Beyond this, though, I work with two different teams. Everybody in those
teams understands me well enough to give me feedback which will help me
match who I <em>already am</em> to the work that I’ve agreed to do. How many
places does <em>that</em> happen? Even as we grow and evolve, this focus on the
individual and their unique outlook thrives. I’m sure there are other
places where this happens, but I’m sure I haven’t heard of them yet.</p>
