Channels of Sharing are Complicated
===================================

Centuries ago, John Milton wrote, "I cannot praise a fugitive and
cloistered virtue," referring, at least in part, to those who keep their
intelligence to themselves. Without some form of communication --
without manifesting that intelligence in word or deed -- there is
generally no evidence of intelligence or intelligent life. Our knowledge
must create ripples in space and time if it is to be shared, and it must
be shared to benefit others. For this reason, we create networks, which
might be defined as "channels of sharing". All virtue and all goodness
is valued only in sharing, whether by having mercy on another person or
communicating the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Only by
sharing do we come to the notice of others, and only with the help of
others do we share the load of living.

Sharing involves risk. Will the other person understand? Will they
accept what I've shared, or turn against me? Will they appreciate what I
have shared, or judge me harshly? All communication involves the risks
of misunderstanding, judgement, and ridicule. We must choose carefully
when sharing information, tools, knowledge -- even compassion, love,
loyalty, and devotion. In a way, that's one of the "equations" of living
in a society, although public social media platforms have made that
more, er, interesting. Often we segregate our sharing based on some
measurable characteristic. For example, we share with people of our own
race, gender, color, or national origin, but not with the "others". And
we share in different ways with different social groups.

In fact, you might say that the average person has as many
personalities as there are groups of people whose opinions they care
about: we are one person at home, another at the office, still another
on the Internet, and yet another when we're golfing, as examples. Each
of these channels can have different rules, mores, idioms, dialects,
and vocabulary. As we grow up, we learn to be \*one\* self, sharing
with everyone in very much the same way, restricting only \*what\* we
share, not \*how\* we share it. You begin to deeply understand the
basics of human communication. If you're serious about it, you begin
to try to normalise your messaging to include less moody prejudice and
more honest opinion, modulated only by personal privacy.

Thus it has been with computer networks. For a very long time, there
were at least as many network protocols -- \*selves\* -- as there were
brands and styles of computers. Different methods were needed to share
information from one system to another, sometimes even involving
specially-crafted physical interface cables to handle the
translation. Eventually, though, computer networks began to gravitate
toward a standard approach, "one self to rule them all", as it were.
This singular personality is known as TCP/IP. Learning how the TCP/IP
protocols work will serve you well in understanding, designing, and
debugging computer networks. Let's get started.
