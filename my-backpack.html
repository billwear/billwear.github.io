            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Dell 15-inch touchscreen laptop running Ubuntu — for when your café “Wi-Fi” is really just a philosophical concept.</li>
              <li>Power adapter — because outlets hide in corners like cryptids.</li>
              <li>2 TB external drive — for those days you accidentally back up the entire Internet.</li>
              <li>Spare phone + charger — the one that actually rings when your main phone “dies” of embarrassment.</li>
              <li>Boot/reload USBs (“red pill” and “blue pill”) — for the moment a stranger says, “Windows just updated itself.”</li>
              <li>Northern Europe power adapter — every coworking space eventually becomes an embassy.</li>

              <li>Camping spork and table knife — because office kitchens never have utensils, just spoons with trauma.</li>
              <li>Roll of quarters ($10) — laundromats, payphones, or convincing vending machines that you’re old-school legit.</li>
              <li>Compact camp shower + poncho — one for protest days, the other for “surprise” building evacuations.</li>
              <li>Spare shirt, socks, and hair ties — for spontaneous overnighters or moral triage in the airport bathroom.</li>
              <li>Large tarp + rope + carabiners — emergency shade at the company picnic or privacy on the redeye floor.</li>
              <li>Hatchet multi-tool — opens coconuts, fixes furniture, or ends HR conversations politely.</li>
              <li>Paracord + matches + fire tube — for re-lighting office morale or roasting marshmallows at a blackout.</li>

            <h2>Why carry all this?</h2>
            <p class="kicker">Because every city is one transformer fire away from becoming the wilderness.</p>
            <p>This bag isn’t paranoia. It’s continuity. It’s comfort when the office HVAC quits, the grid hiccups, or your train dies mid-tunnel. Everything in here has saved a day, a plan, or a reputation at least once.</p>
