Epoch 1772284368, Day 59, Week 9 Prickle-Prickle, Chaos 59, 3192  
PLUG IT IN!!!
### Emologent
#### Mood
Yesterday’s severe attack of Meniere’s — only classified as severe by the fact that Meclizine took some time to arrest it, not by the intensity of the vertigo — nevertheless hangs on in my mind, coloring my perceptions and giving me the uneasy, restless mood of a potential hypochondriac. All the signs, from weird spring weather to the wobbly disposition, seem to simply identify the reality. Still, the fidgety escape mode won’t settle.
#### Energy
Obviously the energy is there, and if I take the high road in my interpretation, it’s good energy. In the last two days, I filed my taxes for the year, which will result in a larger refund than I expected; I took care of my prescription drug policy to go along with Medicare, which removes most of my medicine costs; and I came up with a killer, small purse design, that can be morphed into a dozen different specific sewing products. So the week is clearly a win. But like most humans, I focus on the negative. 
#### Mental Weather
And my mental weather is guarded. Am I imagining the slightly unstable pressure situation in my head, simply because I had some strong vertigo yesterday, or is it hanging on still?
#### Actual Weather
Outside, it’s foggy, which makes me wonder what all kinds of weather can we cram into one weekend?
#### Loop
The loop is extraordinarily positive. Sitting down with Sharan Last night for 10 minutes, looking at my prototype small purse, produced a whole bunch of variations and a fix for the closure problem. I like these kind of loops.
#### Lingering
Also lingering is the idea that I need to find another life-changing action for today. In the last two days I found three. In fact, on Thursday, I found one. On Friday, I found two. So if I keep that streak going, today I should find three. That’s aspirational, but if you’re honest about it, aspirations are all that drives us.
#### Unfinished
It would be easy to hang around in bed and say that my nap is unfinished, but I went to sleep at 8:45 last night, was only awake for about an hour in the middle of the night, and then finally picked up my phone at 6:20, so there’s no conceivable excuse for going back to sleep at this point.
#### Gravity
I think for maybe the first time in my life, or at least the first time that I can remember, clearly, I am actually pushing myself out of devotion to valuable ideas and things I actually want to do, rather than discipline and obligation. Clearly, the obligations are there, but I’m not addressing them in the same old way anymore.
#### Anchor
You might say I’m anchored in possibility instead of responsibility at this moment. It would be nice to retain that.
#### Mokuatsu
And it’s weird. It’s almost like I’m resisting continuing to lie here in the bed and actually write this journal entry, because I know there are things that I need to get up and do, come Hell or high water.
#### Idea Pressure
The purse I’m calling the basic phone sling, with the tagline “The Mini Purse for Maxi Use,“ is suddenly a real thing. I’ve got more than enough denim, canvas, and durable upholstery material that’s suitable for the outside, and probably three or four dozen choices for lining material. Got a ton of the dun-colored, upholstery thread that I’d like to use, which permits, narrow, or seam allowances. I’ve got the machine, space, and time to work on this. Yeah, I’ve got a lingering sinus headache, or maybe what I would call a Meniere’s Migraine, but I’m already certain I can work around that. That’s kind of the hell or high water part.
#### Creative Current
And I should be able to nail other epic tasks today. Will I find three of them? Good question. And of course, at some point, they search for escalating epic counts becomes a waste of time.
#### Gains
Of course, I’m overlooking the very first epic result of today: I’m chomping at the bit to get up and get things done because I’m devoted to the kind of results that I’ve gotten in the last couple of days. This feels like where I want to be.
#### Pivot
One might say the pivot, then, it’s a jump up and get moving. Another might say that the pivot is to gate this impulse in the way that one contains steam to produce energy. Another good question.
#### Signal Boost
Either way, the signal boost is to stick with a task long enough to bring it to an epic stopping point. And that might be the real pivot
#### Rare Value
Today’s rare value, of course, is that I’m having this internal debate at all. And not trying to make a list of the things I can do to make myself feel like I’ve done enough to then loaf for the rest of the day. May not be rare for you, but it feels rare for me
#### Friction
So here’s the day we’re all the friction is internal. Which way are we gonna go? What are we gonna get started? How can we get back to this productive activity that now feels like addictive candy? You don’t see that kind of friction every day.
#### What wants to stay?
Clearly, keeping this dichotomy open is the main thing to keep alive. It’s not fully definable in words, but it is completely comprehensible in emotional terms.
#### What needs to go?
And I think what needs to fall away is already on the floor and can’t get back on the table. I’m not gonna help it.

## JOTIF essay from emologent
#### Key points

1. Feeling fidgety party because of Meniere's attack last night (maybe said enough about that) and because I'm inspired by my successes the past two days to stop lying in bed and get up and do something else legendary or at least epic.  It's probably overkill to build pyramid schemes around success, but there's nothing wrong with prioritizing the big wins over the things that don't make the same level of a difference in our lives.
2. In two days, pulled off three things that improve my position in life.  Shouldn't make this about me, but about "when's the last time you did something that significantly improved your position in life?"
3. We don't wake up perfect every day, maybe not many days.  But adding angst that doesn't belong doesn't get us anywhere.
4. Collaborating with others actually helps.  Even if it's just your spouse.
5. We should be driven by devotion and aspiration, even when our bodies and our checkbooks don't want to cooperate.  When we do wake up that way, we should immediately count that as an epic win already.  And we should let that productive drive be our candy, instead of the mundane checklist of housework, hygiene and bills that don't really move us that far forward. 
6. We should continuously remind ourselves of the resources we do have, and how valuable they can be, and what we might do with them to improve our situation.
7. We should also consider gating our enthusiasm; not curbing it, as the old sitcom says, but neither jumping on our horse and riding madly off in all directions.  Part of this is giving in to our creative urges and our epic vision, but another part is knowing when you've got something, and you need to stop for awhile and evaluate what you've done.  We should keep the epic creative dichotomy open and well-fed, even if it's something we can only express in emotions and not words.
#### Translating toward a thesis
1. Ambition for doing big things that move you forward is where you want to be.
2. There's tons of drive and dopamine in that practice when you start to get caught up.
3. Even when conditions aren't perfect, we can usually something big to move forward.
4. There's a quantum leap waiting when we draw others into our aspirations.
5. Whatever you have or don't have, at least one of your resources is going to stand out.
6. We also need to bank some of that enthusiasm, by leaving linkage and things undone, so the epic moves can sort themselves from the mundane.
#### Clumsy thesis
Genuine ambition, driven by devotion and enthusiasm for rare and valuable achievements, spurred on by an escalating daily ladder of similar successes, can move us forward farther than we'd ever imagine, even when conditions are not perfect and resources are not infinite.  Engage others, follow your drive, and be willing to leave something for tomorrow, so the fire will kick up again when we wake up.
#### Inner fire meta-thesis
Our inner fire burns brightest when we devote ourselves to rare and valuable results.  Looking back at a string of blazing wins pushes us forward, and continuously seeking genuine accomplishment, whatever our condition or resources, always leaves us with a fire that is ready to kick up with the next sunrise.
#### Tentative outline
1. Our inner fire burns brightest in devotion to the rare and valuable.
2. Burning through one epic thing daily gives us a track record to live up to.
3. Seeking genuine, meaningful accomplishment every day, regardless of circumstance, leaves us with embers that kick up with the next sunrise and spur us on to greater achievement.
#### More detailed outline
1. Our inner fire defies simple biology. 
	1. Needs and wants do not explain higher ambitions.
	2. Our hearts desire rare things of lasting value.
	3. Acquiring these things doesn't feel genuine.
	4. Creating them ourselves feels more authentic by far.
	5. Chemical explanations fall short of capturing this flag.
2.  There are at least two potential paths to express our fire.
	1. Want-strive-acquire is an addiction loop. 
		1. We see what others have to offer.
		2. We do uninspired things to gather an exchange of mundane value.
		3. We acquire the wanted object.
		4. Joy fades quickly, and another loop begins with daily slogging.
	2. Vision-devotion-craft is a creation loop.
		1. We see something that, as far as we know, has never existed.
		2. We devote ourselves to studying the vision, developing the skill, learning how to bring this vision about.
		3. We develop the craft to not only bring about the vision, but also create variations and offshoots of our vision.
		4. Joy increases, and we can't wait for the next sunrise to continue creating.
3. Vision-devotion-craft is the road not (often) taken.
	1. We expect geniuses to deliver these ideals
	2. We overlook our own Inner Fire, our capacity to envision and create.
	3. We settle for discipline over devotion while cursing those who rise above.
	4. We all have the gifts, the vision, and the drive to create
		1. Why else would there be a "Parable of the Talents?"
		2. We can all make our own decisions about the source of this creative drive.
		3. We probably can't actually answer that without taking some things on faith.
		4. But even in the Talents Parable, lower esteem comes to those who ignore their aspirations.
4. And those aspirations are self-sustaining
	1. Pick just one day, any day when you can devote a little time to something that really matters to you, something rare and valuable.
		1. Visit your grandmother and spend a few hours with her.
		2. Go to a hospital and ask who hasn't had any visitors in a logn time, and visit with them.
		3. Find a friend or neighbor who's going hungry because of limited funds, and take them out for a nice meal.
		4. This may not be your inner fire, but it will stoke the flames enough to put you on that same path tomorrow.
	2. The next day, remember what you did yesterday, and make every effort to carve out at least a little time to do create value with another rare act.
	3. In only a few days, the pattern becomes a positive habit, and every day you start looking for something epic to achieve; it's all about the person you're becoming, and your emotional being likes this state far more than shopping.
	4. Money and fame are fleeting, so you can't give them your full confidence.  
	5. Real achievement -- something you've crafted with your heart, your hands, your presence or your developed skills (or all of these) -- won't wash away in the mists of time.
5. Soon, you're a different person.  
	1. Someone who jumps up with enthusiasm every day.
	2. Someone who handles the mundane things quickly, without fanfare, with no wasted effort or focus, just to get them out of the way.
	3. Someone who sets aside uninterrupted time to do meaningful, special, rare and valuable things; things that you can look back on that can't be taken away.  
	4. Someone who can no longer be persuaded to be addicted to the consumption loop.
6. The warmth and glow of our inner fire corresponds exactly to how much time we spend stoking it with things that genuinely matter.  
	1. Every day doesn't need to be a forest fire.  Burn slow.
	2. Your best ideas and results come from your own hard work.  Build deep.
	3. No argument can refute craft, care, and compassion.  Be the proof.

#### First draft
Our inner fire defies simple biology.  We all have needs and wants: hunger, companionship, security.  There is always a daily grind for sustenance.  In the midst of all this labor, our hearts desire rare things of lasting value, things that we can't genuinely acquire by the mere exchange of value.  To feel authentic, we must create these rare and valuable things, or the fire within becomes a bed of hot coals that burns our feet.

Want-strive-acquire is an addiction loop, fueled only by discipline and obedience to social expectation.  We see what's on offer, do uninspired and possibly distasteful things to gather enough mundane value to exchange, and then acquire the wanted object.  But joy fades quickly, so we slog our way through another loop, somehow knowing that this is a treadmill, a path that gets us nowhere and leads to nowhere.

By contrast, the vision-devotion-craft cycle is a creation loop.  We see something in our mind's eye, illuminated by the flickering light of our inner fire -- something that, as far as we know, has never existed before.  Giving in to the urge, we devote ourselves to studying the vision, developing the skills, and learning how to bring this vision about.  And in the process, we not only create something new, we also develop variations and offshoots, sparks we can share with others.  And through it all, our joy increases, and we can't wait for the next sunrise to continue creating.
##### The road not (often) taken
We expect this kind of visionary work out of geniuses, people who appear to have extraordinary skills and intelligence and drive.  Society clings to that model, encouraging us to "be normal and fit in," in the process overlooking our own Inner Fire.  We settle for discipline over devotion while quietly cursing or idolizing those who rise above, who make use of their inborn capacity to envision and create. 

In the Parable of the Talents, we see three servants who are given money to hold while the master travels (see the middle of Matthew 25 if you're unfamiliar).  Two of them put that money to use, while a third just buries it.  When the master returns, the two investors are congratulated, while the mundane servant is berated and thrown out.  Whether you ascribe this tale to divine wisdom, mythology, or fanciful storytelling, the point still stands: Lower esteem comes to those who simply go through the motions and ignore their aspirations.
##### All our yesterdays
By the way, those aspirations quickly become self-sustaining.  

Pick just one day, any day when you can devote a little time to something that feels rare and valuable, something that makes a difference.  Take your grandmother some flowers; visit a hospital patient who has no family; take a hungry friend out for a nice meal, no strings, no sales pitch.  This may not be your Inner Fire, exactly, but it will stoke the flames enough to make you consider the same path tomorrow.

And when tomorrow comes, remember what you did yesterday, and make every effort to carve out at least a little creative time to work on something that feels epic.  In only a few days, the pattern becomes a positive habit.  Every day you'll wake up, ready to jump out of bed with enthusiasm, a distaste for the mundane, and deep desires to focus on uninterrupted blocks of time to do meaningful, special, rare and valuable things.  Authentic things. Memorable things.

Money and fame are fleeting, so you can't give them your full confidence.  Real achievement -- something you've crafted with your heart, your hands, your presence, and your rapidly-developing skills -- won't wash away in the mists of time. Nobody will soon forget that you smiled at them. Handmade gifts and kind words live forever.  Don't ever neglect to do what only you can do, and make sure you get very good at doing it and sharing it with others.

The warmth and glow of our Inner Fire corresponds exactly to how much time we spend stoking it with things that genuinely matter.  Every day doesn't need to be a forest fire.  Your best ideas and results come from your own hard work.  No argument can refute craft, care, and compassion, demonstrated daily.  This is why I always say:

Burn slow. Build deep. Be the proof.

## daily journal 
##### 08:03
After restlessly doing my emologent and updating my blog, I’m finally getting up and moving. I put the coffee on, fed the cat, took my morning blood sugar, reading, synced it with my phone, send a message to my nutrition coach, and took my meds. After some fuddling around, I took my blood pressure and got my weight. I probably won’t repeat this journal block every morning, just throwing it in here to remind myself of all the little things I’m supposed to do before I do anything else. As a society, we need bio-beds in the worst way. 
##### 08:25
On to coffee, and a morning journal of the inner fire essay. I quit doing them every day for a while, but they’re just in my blood. This morning, I even tried using AI again, but it still doesn’t even begin to understand what I’m trying to say or how to say it eloquently and with feeling. Probably need to give up on that hope.  Wrote a decent essay, demonstrating all my steps here in the journal (no AI help here, the writing is so seventh-grade).  
##### 10:45
Chatted with my wife while eating "breakfast:" a small piece of sausage from a pig my sister-in-law had butchered, some fresh speckled butter beanscooked in butter, and a big pile of yellow squash (also fresh) cooked in olive oil and Parmesan cheese.  That's kinda the diet for those who don't want metabolic issues with the terrible food we have available these days.
##### 10:59
Time to shower, shave, dress, and all that stuff.  I mean, it's fun hanging around in pajamas, robe, and slippers, but can't go to town that way, if I decide to go to town.
