[MAAS tutorial](https://billwear.github.io/maas-cli-1.html)

Welcome to Bill Wear's personal website. I am active in many places on the Internet, including [Journal of the Inner Fire](https://open.substack.com/pub/williamwear/), [JOTIF](https://jotif.org), [Boho Byte Bags](https://bohobytebags.com), [Solder and Signal](https://solderandsignal.com), and [The Way of Emacs](https://the-way-of-emacs.com).  

Each of these sites expresses a different aspect of my hobbies and interests. Each of them has it's own voice and cadence. I hope you'll find one of them interesting.
