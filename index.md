## Some people can work in noise.
Others must work deeply — or not work at all.

This site is for the second group.

I’m rebuilding this space around a simple idea:

- Some minds integrate information before it becomes language.
- They think at the edge of words.
- For them, discipline and hustle don’t help much.
- Alignment does.

When the conditions are right, these minds produce work that is unusually coherent, dense, and human. When the conditions are wrong, they fragment, stall, or burn out.

I’m writing about that mechanism here — what I call the *edge ego* — and what it means for work, creativity, and daily life.

If this resonates, you’re in the right place.

For now, start here:

More soon. Quietly. Carefully.
