## burn slow. build deep. tune true.

Words and wires and cloth and code;   
I shape what hums or moves or holds.   
The maker's spark in me unfolds.

My name is Bill Wear, and I'm a maker:

* I write [The Journal of the Inner Fire](https://williamwear.substack.com), about devotion, rhythm, and real mastery.
* I play with [solder and signal](https://solderandsignal.com), mostly building radio receivers.
* I use and extend [the Emacs editor](https://the-way-of-emacs.com) as a contribution to open source.
* I sew all sorts of things, though [Boho-style electronics bags](https://bohobytebags.com) are my salable hard product.
* And I use this site as my hub for all these activities (and more).

I also republish and extend my Inner Fire ideas in the [blog](https://billwear.github.io/blog) I write on this site.
