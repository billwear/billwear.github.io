Epoch 1772284368, Day 59, Week 9 Prickle-Prickle, Chaos 59, 3192  
PLUG IT IN!!!
### Emologent
#### Mood
Yesterday’s severe attack of Meniere’s — only classified as severe by the fact that Meclizine took some time to arrest it, not by the intensity of the vertigo — nevertheless hangs on in my mind, coloring my perceptions and giving me the uneasy, restless mood of a potential hypochondriac. All the signs, from weird spring weather to the wobbly disposition, seem to simply identify the reality. Still, the fidgety escape mode won’t settle.
#### Energy
Obviously the energy is there, and if I take the high road in my interpretation, it’s good energy. In the last two days, I filed my taxes for the year, which will result in a larger refund than I expected; I took care of my prescription drug policy to go along with Medicare, which removes most of my medicine costs; and I came up with a killer, small purse design, that can be morphed into a dozen different specific sewing products. So the week is clearly a win. But like most humans, I focus on the negative. 
#### Mental Weather
And my mental weather is guarded. Am I imagining the slightly unstable pressure situation in my head, simply because I had some strong vertigo yesterday, or is it hanging on still?
#### Actual Weather
Outside, it’s foggy, which makes me wonder what all kinds of weather can we cram into one weekend?
#### Loop
The loop is extraordinarily positive. Sitting down with Sharan Last night for 10 minutes, looking at my prototype small purse, produced a whole bunch of variations and a fix for the closure problem. I like these kind of loops.
#### Lingering
Also lingering is the idea that I need to find another life-changing action for today. In the last two days I found three. In fact, on Thursday, I found one. On Friday, I found two. So if I keep that street going, today I should find three. That’s aspirational, but if you’re honest about it, aspirations are all that drives us.
#### Unfinished
It would be easy to hang around in bed and say that my nap is unfinished, but I went to sleep at 8:45 last night, was only awake for about an hour in the middle of the night, and then finally picked up my phone at 6:20, so there’s no conceivable excuse for going back to sleep at this point.
#### Gravity
I think for maybe the first time in my life, or at least the first time that I can remember, clearly, I am actually pushing myself out of devotion to valuable ideas and things I actually want to do, rather than discipline and obligation. Clearly, the obligations are there, but I’m not addressing them in the same old way anymore.
#### Anchor
You might say I’m anchored in possibility instead of responsibility at this moment. It would be nice to retain that.
#### Mokuatsu
And it’s weird. It’s almost like I’m resisting continuing to lie here in the bed and actually write this journal entry, because I know there are things that I need to get up and do, come Hell or high water.
#### Idea Pressure
The purse I’m calling the basic phone sling, with the tagline “The Mini Purse for Maxi Use,“ is suddenly a real thing. I’ve got more than enough denim, canvas, and durable upholstery material that’s suitable for the outside, and probably three or four dozen choices for lining material. Got a ton of the dun-colored, upholstery thread that I’d like to use, which permits, narrow, or seam allowances. I’ve got the machine, space, and time to work on this. Yeah, I’ve got a lingering sinus headache, or maybe what I would call a Meniere’s Migraine, but I’m already certain I can work around that. That’s kind of the hell or high water part.
#### Creative Current
And I should be able to nail other epic tasks today. Will I find three of them? Good question. And of course, at some point, they search for escalating epic counts becomes a waste of time.
#### Gains
Of course, I’m overlooking the very first epic result of today: I’m chomping at the bit to get up and get things done because I’m devoted to the kind of results that I’ve gotten in the last couple of days. This feels like where I want to be.
#### Pivot
One might say the pivot, then, it’s a jump up and get moving. Another might say that the pivot is to gate this impulse in the way that one contains steam to produce energy. Another good question.
#### Signal Boost
Either way, the signal boost is to stick with a task long enough to bring it to an epic stopping point. And that might be the real pivot
#### Rare Value
Today’s rare value, of course, is that I’m having this internal debate at all. And not trying to make a list of the things I can do to make myself feel like I’ve done enough to then loaf for the rest of the day. May not be rare for you, but it feels rare for me
#### Friction
So here’s the day we’re all the friction is internal. Which way are we gonna go? What are we gonna get started? How can we get back to this productive activity that now feels like addictive candy? You don’t see that kind of friction every day.
#### What wants to stay?
Clearly, keeping this dichotomy open is the main thing to keep alive. It’s not fully definable in words, but it is completely comprehensible in emotional terms.
#### What needs to go?
And I think what needs to fall away is already on the floor and can’t get back on the table. I’m not gonna help it.
