### mood

Today my mood is mostly about relief. The greats were all over the place
last night after present opening, which was delayed a day by one of the
grands having to work Christmas. An overload of presents, and lots of
"joyful" running around and screaming. I bowed out about 9:45 PM. My
wife came home later. It's pretty simple, since we live a five-minute
walk away, and this was very much a shirt-sleeve Christmas. Just before
I left last night, I wouldn't have given you ten cents for my mood, but
today, it's better. I walked over and had breakfast with the Nashville
relatives before they left at about 10:30. Hung around for a while,
talked a little politics, and left. Then I walked back. My wife is still
sleeping soundly, no intent to bother her until she wakes on her own.
Back to some normalcy, I guess.

### energy

My energy is suprisingly good. I managed to snag a book called "Emacs as
Your Operating System" and was intending to go through it in detail, but
it turns out that it will be a slower thing. Lots of the suggestions are
at the same level of expertise as my current init files, just different,
and the suggestions don't match me. I did do some updates from the
startup section and implemented an early-init.el, but not much beyond
that. I initially drove over to the father-in-law's house to visit and
have breakfast, but brought the car back to the house and walked back
over to leave a vehicle for my wife. Both the walk over and the walk
back created no exertion whatsoever, so a couple of observations: the 53
pounds I've lost this year make a big difference in stamina and
mobility, and the weather this time of year is nearly perfect, at least
this year.

### mental wx

My mental weather is similarly clear: a few clouds still, and a threat
of indecision, but nothing on the immediate radar. Nice.

### actual wx

The actual weather is a mix of clouds and bobbing temps, betweemn 74 and
75 over time. Rain later? Not concerned enough to look at the forecast,
anyway.

### loop

The usual loops of worry and gotta-dos are suspended still. I guess the
holiday weekend – or maybe the period between Christmas and New Year's –
has that whole stress thing suppressed. I don't know, but I'm willing to
be grateful for it and let it go at that.

### lingering

There's still this lingering dichotomy between focusing on one public
hobby and focusing on several. I could just sew for a while, and see how
far that will take me, or I could work on more hobbies. The trouble is
the way it splits my time, or maybe I should say, splits my mode of
being. I sort of get into a hobby and start viewing life from those
angles, and switching keeps me caught up in recalibration time. It's
kind of disconcerting to be always switching modes. It feels better and
more continuous to live full-time in just one gestalt. I think I'm just
gonna have to accept that for awhile. I do know that I'm well equipped
for other hobbies if I should decide to switch.

### unfinished

That said, I have some unfinished things in my electronics hobby that
will have to just remain ideas now. I have the components for a great
shortwave antenna, including a very natural, lightning-protected
telephone post in my yard, and all the cable and adapters to create a
balanced HF antenna. I've got several shortwave receivers I can listen
to any time, and I still maintain a workable transmitter, license and
callsign, but it's sort of become a back-of-the-stove thing. No
reasoning why, just preferences. I think the lesson for me is let some
unfinished things stay unfinished until they really want to be
completed.

### gravity

My gravity is very strongly influenced by things I'm spending money on.
I have spent a lot of "little money" on sewing gadgets, books, patterns,
and material. I will probably need some different material for some of
the things I have in mind, but there's a lot that I can make with the
stuff that I have. I should work hard to keep that learning going. Also,
I'm thinking about turning my substack into more of a blog, for now, and
less of an essay run. I might be essayed out in the short term, or maybe
not. I get ideas, and I seem to run with them for the short term, but
then I let them fade a little. I guess you just have to test ideas to
see if they work for you, and keep moving and morphing until the groove
finds you.

### anchor

I think words are a good anchor for me. It's very pleasant to sit in
front of a laptop and type thoughts like this, mostly just reporting
what I'm feeling and seeing, without judgment or teaching. I probably
need to remember that.

### resisting

I'm resisting letting the pressures of industry creep into my
retirement. Yes, I need to do some things that will earn me extra money,
if I'd like to maintain a little larger lifestyle. No, I will not go
hungry or be without shelter, water, electricity, or broadband. But I'm
not the kind of person to sit back and work crossword puzzles to while
away the hours. Not my style.

### idea pressure

The D&D ideas about sewing don't go away, really. I like the idea of
being able to create costumes and accessories for D&D, and there is a
thriving community of D&D lovers on the threads platform. I really
should get more involved. One of my hobbies is configuring emacs, but I
think I've probably got a configuration that I'm not really interested
in changing much. Yeah, I could do to-do lists more, but they repel me
at the moment. Go figure.

### creative current

My creative current is a little low-key right now; maybe it's the end of
the year. Maybe it's just a resting phase. Dunno, we'll just let it play
itself out.

### pivot

In that vein, no pivots today, much. Thinking about driving to town to
see what after-Christmas bargains are out there. Probably ought to pay a
few more bills, maybe. I dunno.

### signal boost

I think part of the signal boost is about being comfortable without
stress and anxiety.

### rare value

One of the places where I can bring rare value is being sensible. I'm
beginning to really see through the scams of other people. I think
another place where there's rare value is doing things without any
particular needs or wants at all: just doing something that seems like
something I ought to be doing and letting it take over your life until
you find something you really needed. Sounds like a plan.

### points of friction

None ATM. And I'm glad for that.

### quest pulse

It's kindof like just roaming the village outside the dungeon, looking
for interesting stories to pursue.

### todays ember

Let's see what's out there.

### what wants to live

No judgment. It can all kinda keep today.

### what can fall away

Meh. Let it fall away on its own.
