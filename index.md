Ouch!  That felt good!
### Emologent
#### Mood
I’m feeling very happy about yesterday: significant, meaningful progress with no angst or resistance. The right mix of work and play and thoughtfulness and craft work and house stuff. Even some silliness and screwing around. At the end of the day, though the most important things were moved far forward.
#### Energy
Energy yesterday was a direct product of eating a lot healthier. That in turn because I took an hour and cooked the other day and put it all in the fridge. Late in the evening I binged on ice cream and regretted it later. I doubt I’ll make that mistake again. Yesterday was probably my best day ever. I really earned every minute and every result.
#### Mental Weather
My mental weather is good. The weird spring weather has me stumbling a bit more (Meniere’s), but nothing I haven’t managed before. It’s more often an aggravation to have a built in weather station, but maybe I just need to learn how to operate it. 
#### Actual Weather
It rained, as predicted. Brief, heavy, weird time of day, but rain.
#### Loop
Nothing’s looping except the theme from Superman. I’ve always considered that song bad karma because it can make you lean towards thinking you can defy physics, but sometimes it just sticks in your head. About the only way to turn it off is to replace it with the oompa-loompa song from Willy Wonka, which is like instant karmic punishment. ,,,,,chameleon, if you ask me.
#### Lingering
Fell back to sleep here, with the dark skies and my cat cuddling my feet and encouraging a nap. And honestly, isn’t that the way it should be? If I moved the needle that far forward yesterday, clearly I can do it again today. Part of it has to do with this file, which I started using as a daily journal weeks ago, but yesterday it organically morphed into a comprehensive, single-source life management system. Sounds like hyperbole, but I kid you not. Gonna put more in it today.
#### Unfinished
What does finished even mean? If you don’t have an open project, who even are you?
#### Gravity
For the first time in my life, I actually figured something out with no reference points. Just said, “You know, let me start where I am now and just go from there.” Really good day. Kinda expecting the same today.
#### Anchor
And this journal is my anchor. When I first started writing files like this in vi on Unix decades ago, it didn’t work because it wasn’t ubiquitous. Now with cell phones and seamless sync and programmable templates, here we are. 
#### Mokuatsu
I’m determined to let fear, uncertainty and doubt die by ignoring them. More than ignorance, actually disinviting them from my psyche. 
#### Idea Pressure
Yesterday, I found $7700 I didn’t know I had; I properly prioritized dozens of longstanding tasks and important projects, and even gave the commercial ones catchy names. I made major decisions, like selling off my professional dungeon master kit (very well articulated kit with its own handmade carry sling, see FB marketplace). It was just time; as Thoreau said, “I have other lives to live and I have no more time for this one.”
#### Creative Current
I suppose I should be perfecting tiny salables, but I seem to want to work on my coffee-themed quilt (“Brewhemian Rhapsody”). I’m leaning into my gut feelings here.
#### Gains
Yesterday was a win until the very end of the day, when I binged on ice cream. I got that close, y’all. Not many steps further today and it might be nearly perfect.
#### Pivot
The pivot is not to question myself, just make good notes and rolling plans and keep moving.
#### Signal Boost
I just need to add more life tracking to this file. Be unafraid to share. 
#### Rare Value
My rare value might be living my life in the open. Jennicam pioneered this in pictures. Maybe I can pioneer it in words.
#### Friction
My only regret so far is lying in bed too long, but I can use the clingy cat as a source of friction.
#### What wants to stay?
This file format, with its template. Seems like a win.
#### What needs to go?
A bunch of other apps and planners and journals. Too many distractions. They all need to go.

## daily journal

##### 05:19
Woke up early-ish. Turned up the A/C (too cold in here) and jumped into Obsidian on my iPhone to run my daily journal (you’re looking at it).  Got about halfway through my emologent before I realized that I was nodding off, so I put the phone down and slept until about 08:45.  Nice.

##### 08:45
Got up and fed the cat.  She was happy, and came back to cuddle my feet for while.  Worked for another 45 minutes in bed, just doing typical social things and systems checks and such as that.  Phones could make us really lazy, if they haven’t already.

##### 10:05
Decided to keep my journal live on [Substack](https://open.substack.com/pub/williamwear/p/journal-of-the-inner-fire?r=5l1qei&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) and here. I wonder if I’ll update this through the day?  Maybe, or just resort to posting before I go to sleep so you see the whole thing.  Nothing to hide here.

##### 10:31
Got the daily journal up and running on my GitHub page (you're looking at it).  First coffee's almost done, so shower time.
##### 11:14
Slow shower, prep, dress time.  Semi-lazy up till this point, but now I need to get serious about stuff.
##### 11:23
Breakfast.  Cold meatballs and double-buttered butter beans.  It's my Virta diet, supposed to help me lose weight (that part has worked) and control Type 2 Diabetes without so much medication (that part we're still working on.)  Feels like you're in a POW camp eating out of a small bowl of rice, but that's the SuperSizeMe American diet talking.
##### 11:31
Pinged my wife.  She's been staying with her best friend (8 minutes away, basically a neighbor).  Best friend's husband is in the hospital / rehab for an extended recovery, so my wife is there for various types of support through this.
