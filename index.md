## burn slow. build deep. tune true.

Hi, I'm Bill, and I'm a maker.
I build things out of words, bits, cloth, and silicon.
Come watch me work.

- edit `_layouts/default.html` to change the chrome
- edit `assets/css/main.css` to change the look
- edit this `index.md` to change the home content

want a post? there is a sample: [_first post_](/blog/first-post/).
