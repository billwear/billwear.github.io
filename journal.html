FORTUNE
If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything.

DDATE
Today is Setting Orange, the 1st day of Bureaucracy in the YOLD 3191

EMOLOGENT
        MOOD: triumphant, really.  i nuked emacs on the same day we nuked nagasaki, so it's memorable, though that's kind of a grim memory.
      ENERGY: good; strong; very resistant to doing anything much workwise, but i can squeak that in because it's support week.
   MENTAL WX: decent; a little confused at times until i started back with taskwarrior, calendar, and my vim journal.
        LOOP: i'm still feeling like there's more i need to do to avoid being in the bottom 10% of the heatmap again, and i feel like i'm not doing it.
  UNFINISHED: my 360 plan isn't moving forward as fast as i'd like; i'm not growing into my infp identity as fast as i'd like.
   LINGERING: canonical is turning into a real shitshow, and i can't tell how bad it's going to be.
     GRAVITY: i need to do some things to secure my future, but i have no fucking idea what that is, exactly.  need to run with it.
   RESISTING: panicking, mostly, although this emologent has panicked me a bit.
       PIVOT: need to clean up my web act: too much stuff, too many initiatives, too much going on; need to pare it down some, though i hate it.
SIGNAL BOOST: get some things selling on FB marketplace again, will make me feel a little better.
    REGROUND: coffee; always more coffee.
    REMINDER: i'm probably not going to crash in the 360 this time if i vote myself high enough, i think it will compensate.
  RARE VALUE: sharon k's notes about what i'm typing helping her, and the fact that i started out posting daily and haven't been keeping that up.
     BLOCKER: it's me knowing what to do, how to pare down the list and make better choices, stop doing so damn much and making nearly no progress on any of the things.

JOURNAL

15:17 today is the day that we dropped the second atomic bomb on nagasaki (in our time, which is just before lunch next day in Japan).  fitting that today is the day i nuked my emacs config for org-mode, which was starting to really annoy me anyway.  don't tell anyone.

16:12 removing emacs is helpful because it creates fewer rabbit holes and less friction, with more showing up, which is how INFPs win.  the AI advice is not to keep trying for the grand arc; take a 60-day sabbatical from the parked projects; do the FB marketplace stuff; set a tiny floor for substack every. single. day.  let the graph catch up to who i'm already becoming.

16:30 and i'm making even more changes now, moving things out of the cryptic unix directories and into something i can actually use repeatedly.

16:52 done.  and i'm 8 minutes away from calling it a day, since i started at 8am.
