  <h1>kaizen, or the mustard seed</h1>

  <p>When you believe (as I do) that your actions define your personal meaning, inaction is anathema.  When it comes to large tasks, goals, dreams even, I have a "point of infinite procrastination," which to me represents ultimate meaninglessness.  In some ways, this is the point at which my philosphy inverts itself: Nothing I'm doing at the moment has any particular meaning, so why should I bother to act?  It's a mood, at best.</p>

  <p>The more tired I am, the easier it is to become meaningless.  At 11pm, my typical bedtime, I often continue sitting on the couch for a minute or two, trying to "work up the energy" to go to bed.  This is doubly sad, because my couch *is* my bed, and if I'm tired enough, I will just sleep in my clothes.</p>

  <h2>Baby steps</h2>

  <p>Every once in a while through my life, I'd flirt with the idea of *kaizen*.  If you're not familiar, it's the concept of starting very small and using incremental changes to slowly change the world.  I'm not a neuroscientist, and no more than an amateur psychologist, so anything I say on this is just a personal opinion, but I think it has to do with flying under my own radar.  It doesn't trip my "why are you expending effort?" alarm and send me into a sleepy spiral of nested meanings that sometimes haunt me like barbershop mirrors late at night.</p>

  <p>Kaizen became more real for me when I started working with someone who approached life a little differently.  He would say, "Just get started: Get something going, even if it's not great.  You'll find yourself motivated to do more and might even do great work."  He's quite right.</p>

  <p>I began to experience this idea of "start small and build" during a Saturday yardwork session.  It was early spring, and as usual for the swamp where I live, plants quickly get out of hand before it's warm and dry enough to deal with them.  Every tool in my arsenal, and a couple in my neighbor's shed, were avaialble to me.  But where to start?</p>

  <p>Then my co-worker's words came to me.  I don't remember where I started. I just picked up some random tool and went to find the worst example of something the tool would fix, and fixed it.  After a little while, what that tool could do seemed eclipsed by a different problem, solved by some other tool, so I switched.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day, I had done a *marvelous* job of shaping up the yard.  I was *very* proud of my efforts, and with valid reason.  But I made no plan, created no structure, and prioritized only on the fly as the day went on.</p>

  <p>My co-worker was thrilled a few weeks later, when I showed them that I'd added their rule to the top of my list of rules, as rule #1.</p>

  <h2>Linkage</h2>
  
  <p>Years ago, when I aspired to be a fiction writer, I moved to a new city to take a technical writing job, leaving my extended family behind.  My brother gifted me a writing guidebook that recommended Hemingway's approach to momentum.</p>

  <p>It's called "linkage."  When you've reached the limit of either time or writing flow, stop mid-sentence and leave it in the typewriter.  When you come back tomorrow, says the theory, you will automatically jump in right where you left off and continue writing.</p>

  <p>I think it works for me because I can't stand to leave things unfinished.  When I step back from a job not fully done, my mind somehow refuses to erase the context and stores it somewhere for the next time I'm able to continue the job.</p>

  <p>It works for me.  Though it may depend on your workstyle and temperament, I think it's *at least* worth a try for anyone.</p>
