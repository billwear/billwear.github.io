    <h1>
      Hello, world!
    </h1>
    <p>My name is Bill Wear, and I live in the southern United States, in a legacy family farmhouse that I bought in January 2024. There's some farmland attached that's owned by other family members.</p>
    <p>I am an Electrical Engineer by training, and a Unix / Emacs aficionado by choice.  <!-- You can follow my EE exploits at <a href="solderandsignal.com">Solder & Signal</a>, and my Emacs tinkering at <a href="the-way-of-emacs.com">The Way of Emacs</a>. -->  I am still growing and learning in my late sixties, and you can follow my personal development studies on my substack, <a href="https://williamwear.substack.com/">Journal of the Inner Fire</a>.</p>
