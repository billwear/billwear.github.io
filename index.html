  <h1>Hey, I'm Bill Wear.</h1>

  <p>
    I write, I build, I document, I tinker. Sometimes I publish essays about
    <a href="https://williamwear.substack.com">making better decisions</a>.
    Sometimes I help people understand complex systems. Most of the time, I’m just thinking with my hands.

  <h2>Now Playing</h2>
  <p>
    Right now I'm rebuilding everything: my Emacs, my studio, my site, my schedule. You can watch it come together here.
  </p>

  <h2>My credo</h2>
  <p><strong>Say what you mean</strong>; because telepathy is still in beta testing.</p>
  <p><strong>Be choosy with your media</strong>, because your brain thinks it’s real.
    Unless, of course, you’re watching someone paint happy little trees.</p>
  <p><strong>Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention</strong>; otherwise,
    you’ll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just
    asked for the time.</p>
  <p><strong>Do what you love</strong>; life’s too short not to ply your craft. Just don’t
    expect it to pay the bills, unless your craft is printing money.</p>
  <p><strong>Keep it simple</strong>; complex plans involve running, and who’s got the
    energy for that?</p>
  <p><strong>Start small and build a little at a time</strong>; a mosaic is more beautiful
    than the finest concrete, and way less likely to get you sued for
    improper construction.</p>
  <p><strong>Network</strong>; because who else will laugh at your “I’m not a robot”
    jokes?</p>
  <p><strong>Be who you are</strong>; even a bent wire can carry a great light, especially
    in a modern art exhibit.</p>
  <p><strong>Build for strength, not just speed</strong>; the hare may have had more
    Instagram followers, but the tortoise won the race.</p>
  <p><strong>Hack</strong>; just remember, “try it and see” doesn’t apply to skydiving or
    lion taming.</p>
  <p><strong>Under-promise and over-deliver</strong>; because everyone loves a surprise,
    especially when it’s not another birthday card.</p>
  <p><strong>Divide and conquer</strong>; because life is essentially a giant game of
    strategy board games.</p>
  <p><strong>Do one thing well</strong>; remember, unicorns are famous for just one horn.</p>
  <p><strong>Use what you have</strong>; unless it’s a floppy disk, then maybe it’s time
    to upgrade.</p>
  <p><strong>Use levers, not people</strong>; because people are terrible at being levers,
    they keep asking for coffee breaks.</p>
  <p><strong>Release early, release often</strong>; otherwise, you’re just hoarding
    half-baked ideas, and there’s no market for those.</p>
  <p><strong>Distrust all claims for the one true way</strong>; except for pizza, pizza is
    always the answer.</p>
  <p><strong>Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans</strong>; all things are possible,
    except maybe skiing through a revolving door.</p>
  <p><strong>Think big: you are the universe</strong>. And like any good universe,
    remember to occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just
    without the big bang.</p>
  <p><strong>Abhor violence in all its forms</strong>, even contradicting others. Keep
    your peace, hold your tongue, and avoid turning into a debate club
    mascot.</p>
  <p><strong>Practice the Prime Directive</strong>; unless you’re in a sci-fi movie, then
    totally ignore it.</p>
