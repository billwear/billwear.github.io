	    **** the quiet art of attention
	  </summary>
	  <p>
	    There comes a moment in life, often in the quietest of hours, when
	    one realizes that the world will continue on its wayward course,
	    indifferent to our desires or frustrations. And it is then, perhaps,
	    that a subtle truth begins to emerge: the only thing we truly possess,
	    the only thing we might, with enough care, exert some mastery over, is
	    our mind. It is not a realization of resignation, but rather of
	    liberation. For if the mind can be ordered, if it can be made still in
	    the midst of this restless life, then we have already discovered the key
	    to a deeper kind of freedom.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** observe your thoughts
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    But how does one begin? It is not with grand declarations or bold,
	    sweeping changes. That would miss the point entirely. Rather, it is with
	    a gentle attention to the present, a deliberate shift in the way we move
	    through the world. We begin by paying attention to what our mind
	    does—its wanderings, its anxieties, its compulsions. It is a garden
	    untended, overgrown with concerns that may not even be our own. And the
	    first step is simply to watch, to observe how the mind moves, without
	    judgment, without rush.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In this quiet observation, we begin to see patterns. The mind leaps
	    from one thing to another, rarely resting. It is caught in a web of
	    habits, most of which we never consciously chose. But, once we notice
	    this, a door opens. There is space, however small, between the thoughts.
	    And in that space, if we are patient, we can decide how to respond
	    rather than being dragged along by every impulse or fear. This is not
	    about control in the traditional sense, but about clarity. To act, not
	    from reflex, but from intent.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It is a simple beginning, but one of great consequence. For when we
	    reclaim our attention, even in this small way, we are no longer mere
	    passengers on the journey. We become, in a sense, our own guides.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** new understandings
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    As we grow in this practice of attention, something else becomes
	    clear: much of what occupies our thoughts is unnecessary. The mind is
	    cluttered, filled with concerns that seem urgent but, on closer
	    inspection, do little to serve our deeper well-being. Simplification is
	    not just a matter of decluttering our physical surroundings—it is a way
	    of thinking, of living. As we quiet the noise within, we see more
	    clearly what truly matters. We focus, not on everything, but on the
	    essentials. We pare down, not by force, but by choice.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This process of simplification is not an escape from complexity. It
	    is, in fact, a way of engaging with it more meaningfully. There are
	    things in life that are intricate, yes, but not everything needs our
	    attention at once. What truly requires our effort can be approached in
	    small steps, in manageable pieces. The mind works best when it is
	    focused on one thing at a time, when it is allowed to give itself fully
	    to the task at hand. In this way, the most complex of undertakings
	    becomes simple, not because it is easy, but because we have allowed it
	    to unfold naturally, one step after the other.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** it's a process
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    It is tempting, in moments of ambition, to think that we must change
	    everything all at once, that the path to mastery or peace requires a
	    sudden, dramatic shift. But this is rarely the case. In truth, most
	    lasting changes come from small, deliberate actions. It is in the
	    repetition of these small actions, over time, that we build strength,
	    that we build the habits of mind that lead to deeper clarity. Just as a
	    mountain is climbed not in great leaps but in steady, measured steps, so
	    too is the mind brought into alignment by daily, patient attention to
	    the way we think.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    But in this process, we must remember something important: life is
	    not meant to be rushed through. It is not a race, nor is it a problem to
	    be solved. It is an experience to be lived, and living well requires
	    presence. To focus on one thing deeply, to give it your full attention,
	    is to experience it fully. And when we do this, something remarkable
	    happens. Time, which so often feels like it is slipping through our
	    fingers, begins to slow. Moments become rich, textured. Even the
	    simplest of tasks takes on a new significance when approached with care,
	    with attention.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This is the quiet art of living well. It does not demand that we
	    abandon the world, but that we engage with it more mindfully. It asks
	    that we slow down, that we look more closely, that we listen more
	    carefully. For in doing so, we discover that much of what we
	    seek—clarity, peace, even strength—was always within reach. It was
	    simply waiting for us to stop, to pay attention, and to begin again
	    with intention.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The mind, like a garden, requires tending. It needs patience, a
	    steady hand, and, above all, consistency. There will be days when it
	    seems unruly, when old habits return, and when focus feels
	    elusive. But these days, too, are part of the process. Each small
	    effort, each moment of renewed attention, builds upon the last. Over
	    time, these moments accumulate, and what was once difficult becomes
	    second nature.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    And so, the journey to mastery of the mind begins not
	    with grand gestures but with the simplest of practices: the practice
	    of paying attention. Attention to the present, attention to what truly
	    matters, and attention to the quiet spaces in between. In this way,
	    step by step, thought by thought, we move closer to that elusive state
	    of clarity, of peace, and of freedom.

	    **** media mindfulness
	  </summary>
	  <p>
	    What we see becomes a part of us: A favorite streaming series; social media; news sites: The stories,
	    pictures, and videos you take in seem harmless -- just passsing the
	    time. But if you search your feelings (Luke), you know these things
	    affect you: how you think and feel, and more importantly, how you make
	    decisions. Even if they seem unreal or ridiculous?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Media (movies, TV shows, video games, and social media) can be a huge
	    part of our lives. It's easy to spend hours every day staring passively
	    at screens, absorbing whatever comes into your mind. But here's the
	    thing: our brains are sponges. No, really, they actually are, basically,
	    and they soak up all that stuff, and it shapes our identity, thinking,
	    and beliefs.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** the power of stories
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Our brains react to sounds and images almost as if we having the
	    experience ourselves. Ever felt scared during a horror movie, or cheered
	    when Superman wins? Our brains can't always tell the difference between
	    what's real and what's CGI. These powerful feelings and reactions stay
	    with us long after the movie ends.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The more we see something, the more it becomes a part of us. If we
	    watch shows that are always full of violence, we might start to think
	    the world is a scarier place than it really is. If we constantly see
	    perfect-looking people on social media, we might start to feel bad about
	    ourselves, even though we know those pictures are often edited or
	    filtered.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** media shapes our beliefs
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    It's not just our emotions that are affected by what we watch—our
	    beliefs and values can be shaped by media, too. For example, if we
	    always see certain groups of people portrayed in negative ways, we might
	    start to believe those stereotypes, even if we know better. Or if we see
	    unrealistic images of beauty, we might begin to think that’s how
	    everyone should look.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Even when something seems silly or absurd, it can still have an
	    impact. Cartoons, for example, might exaggerate things for laughs, but
	    they can also send messages about how people should act or what’s
	    considered normal. Over time, these messages can become a part of our
	    own thinking, without us even realizing it.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** being mindful
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    So, what can we do about it? The key is to be mindful of what we
	    watch and how much time we spend in front of screens. Being mindful
	    means paying attention to how media makes us feel and think. If
	    something makes us feel bad or seems unrealistic, it’s okay to step away
	    or choose something else.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It's also important to balance the media we consume. Watching
	    different types of shows, reading various kinds of books, and following
	    a mix of people on social media can help us see the world in a more
	    balanced way. We should choose content that makes us think, teaches us
	    something new, or simply makes us feel good.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** conclusion
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Media is a powerful tool that can shape who we are and how we see the
	    world. By being mindful of what we watch and how it affects us, we can
	    make better choices that help us grow in positive ways. Remember, just
	    because something is on a screen doesn’t mean it’s real—or that it
	    should become a part of who we are.

	    **** truth
	  </summary>
	  <p>
	    For much of my youth, I was a casual liar.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    As a teenager grappling with immense personal trauma — from the loss
	    of my sister, through my dad’s continual demands for perfection, to the
	    breakdown of my family, to the abuse by a trusted teacher — I found
	    myself spinning tales as a form of escape. This teacher exploited my
	    vulnerability, which led me down a dark path of shame and deceit. I was
	    afraid to be myself, and I hated myself for years — partly for lying,
	    and partly out of shame.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Lies became a coping mechanism, a way to navigate a world that seemed
	    too painful to engage with honestly. Each falsehood was a tiny fortress
	    wall, a way to protect myself from judgment or further injury. But as
	    with all fortresses, the walls eventually closed in. My escape became a
	    prison.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** breaking free
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Shame haunted me until, years later, I found the strength to reveal
	    the truth. This confession didn’t immediately change my habits of
	    dishonesty, but it sparked a crucial transformation. Eventually, as
	    other victims came forward, we used the media and the legal system to
	    amplify our stories, which was profoundly cathartic. Within months, the
	    need to lie diminished; I reclaimed my voice and my truth.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Eventually, other boys came forward, and we formed a sort of riot
	    squad that used the full power of the press and the legal system to be
	    heard and acknowledged. It was cathartic. I won’t say my lying vanished
	    right away, but it was completely gone within about eight months.
	    Somehow, having gotten the shame out of my system, I felt worthy to
	    speak my truth again.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The liberation I experienced by breaking free from lies highlighted a
	    deeper realization: the truth isn’t just a moral choice; it’s a
	    practical one. As Sam Harris writes in his book Lying, even small lies
	    create unnecessary burdens. Every lie is a weight on the mind, demanding
	    memory, calculation, and anxiety. In contrast, the truth is liberating
	    in its simplicity. When you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember
	    your fabrications. You are free to be fully present in the moment.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** a deceptive culture
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Our society rewards deception, whether it’s
	    sparing Uncle Ray’s feelings about his unloved Brussels sprouts, or
	    embellishing our lives on social media to match an illusion of
	    perfection. “Best foot forward” is the winning move in a popularity
	    contest, even if it means filters, Photoshop, and carefully curated
	    vignettes that highlight only the happy side of life.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Sam Harris argues that these “white lies” are not harmless. They
	    undermine trust, complicate relationships, and diminish genuine
	    connection. The moment we decide someone can’t handle the truth, we
	    reduce their agency and limit the possibility of real understanding. The
	    small deceits we justify for convenience or politeness create ripples of
	    confusion and mistrust.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I reached a breaking point and chose transparency over pretense. This
	    doesn’t mean I overshare, but I’ve learned to value clarity and
	    simplicity. When something is private, I simply say, “pass,” respecting
	    my boundaries without deceit. I just speak the truth, as clearly and
	    simply as I can express it. What you see is largely what you get.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** rewards of authenticity
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Dropping the guise was transformative. Those who favored
	    superficiality drifted away, replaced by individuals who appreciate
	    honesty. Now, I can express my doubts, voice my opinions, and confront
	    my past abuse without the shadows of fear and shame. This honesty has
	    not only mended old wounds but also fostered genuine relationships and
	    made daily interactions more straightforward.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Suddenly, I have friends again. People listen to my opinion and act
	    on it. They compliment me when I do well and feel comfortable correcting
	    me when I do poorly. It isn’t at all the horrible ordeal that I imagined
	    it would be. All of the angst I felt over my abuse had gotten conflated
	    with a false undercurrent of bad karma and paranoia. In short, I am now
	    completely open and honest with people, and nothing strange has
	    happened.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Living truthfully has simplified my life in unexpected ways. I can
	    decline invitations without guilt, discuss my limitations openly, and
	    often find that plans adapt to accommodate my honest input. The practice
	    of being frank has taught me to address underlying stresses and
	    uncomfortable truths promptly, avoiding the complexities that come with
	    deception.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** a foundation for life
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Truth is more than a personal choice; it’s a foundation for
	    meaningful living. In a world where misinformation, posturing, and
	    “alternative facts” cloud our collective judgment, the commitment to
	    truth becomes revolutionary. It cuts through noise and creates clarity.
	    It builds resilience because facing reality — however difficult —
	    prepares us for genuine growth.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Even the smallest lies undermine
	    our integrity. They separate us from reality and from each other. When
	    we lie, we create distance. When we tell the truth, we invite
	    understanding. Living authentically means embracing this understanding,
	    even when it’s uncomfortable. It means building trust, not just with
	    others, but with ourselves.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In embracing total honesty, I’ve discovered a life where authenticity
	    leads to both personal freedom and deeper connections. It’s a journey
	    from darkness into a life filled with genuine interaction and peace. The
	    weight of deception has lifted, replaced by the lightness of truth. I
	    highly recommend it.

	    **** my path
	  </summary>
	  <p>
	    this is a manifesto for open source and digital integrity that i call "the netizen way."
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    in an increasingly interconnected world, being a netizen — a citizen of the digital realm — is both a privilege and a responsibility. to navigate the vast, open seas of the internet while championing the ideals of open source, we need more than just tools and technology. we need principles, a compass for integrity, collaboration, and authenticity.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    this credo isn’t just a personal ethos; it’s a guide for every netizen who believes in the power of open source and the transformative potential of the internet. It’s about living with clarity, creativity, and purpose in a digital landscape that is still being shaped by those bold enough to contribute.
	  </p>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** say what you mean
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      in the world of open source, clarity is everything. code comments, documentation, and communication with contributors are the backbone of collaboration. say what you mean — because telepathy is still in beta testing, and ambiguity kills projects faster than bugs do. transparency and directness ensure that everyone shares the same understanding and direction. if we can’t express our ideas clearly, we can’t build them together.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** be choosy with your media
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      our minds are shaped by what we consume. misinformation, clickbait, and noise clutter the digital landscape. as netizens, we must be choosy with our media. trust verified sources. seek out communities and creators who foster knowledge, not outrage. when contributing to open source, let your work reflect reality — not distortions. and if you need a break, there’s always someone painting happy little trees to remind you of simpler joys.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      communication is the heart of the internet. whether you’re in a github discussion, an irc channel, or a mailing list, speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention. misunderstandings online are easy, and clarity is the antidote. open source thrives on respectful discourse and mutual understanding. if you want to ask for help or offer feedback, precision and attentiveness make all the difference. otherwise, you might end up discussing quantum physics when you just wanted the version number.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** do what you love
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      open source is fueled by passion. developers, writers, designers, and maintainers contribute because they love what they do. life’s too short not to ply your craft. but remember — not every passion pays the bills, unless your craft is printing money. find joy in your contributions and remember that sharing your knowledge is its own reward.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** keep it simple
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      in both code and life, complexity breeds frustration. keep it simple. elegant solutions are maintainable solutions. complex plans are like software with unnecessary dependencies — they break under pressure. a straightforward, robust design is worth more than a convoluted mess. simplicity scales; complexity fails.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** start small and build a little at a time
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      great projects don’t spring into existence fully formed. they start with a single commit, a basic readme, or a simple script. start small and build a little at a time. each contribution is a tile in the mosaic. incremental progress is sustainable, and small wins lead to big victories. remember, a mosaic is more beautiful than the finest concrete — and way less likely to collapse under its own weight.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** network
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      no netizen thrives alone. the power of open source lies in its community. network; connect with people who share your values and interests. collaboration sparks innovation, and the collective wisdom of the community propels us forward. besides, who else will laugh at your “i’m not a robot” jokes?
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** be who you are
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      authenticity is your superpower. in a digital world where personas are easily crafted, be who you are. even a bent wire can carry a great light. your unique perspective, skills, and experiences are valuable. open source thrives on diversity, and your honest voice makes the community stronger.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** build for strength, not just speed
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      in a world obsessed with quick wins and instant gratification, build for strength, not just speed. the hare may have more followers, but the tortoise reaches the finish line. resilient systems, thoughtful contributions, and solid principles outlast fads and quick hacks. longevity matters.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** hack
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      hack — explore, experiment, and learn through doing. but remember, “try it and see” doesn’t apply to skydiving or lion taming. in the realm of code, hacking is the path to discovery. iterate, fail fast, and grow. open source was built by hackers who dared to try new things.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** under-promise and over-deliver
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      trust is earned through reliability. under-promise and over-deliver. surprise people with your commitment, not with missed deadlines. in the open-source world, consistency and follow-through matter. when you say you’ll contribute, deliver. when you deliver more than expected, the community thrives.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** divide and conquer
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      big problems are daunting. divide and conquer. break down tasks, distribute responsibilities, and tackle issues systematically. life is a giant strategy game, and open source is no different. a thousand small fixes can solve a massive problem.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** do one thing well
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      in a world of multi-purpose tools, do one thing well. unix taught us the power of simplicity, and this principle applies to code, projects, and life. be the unicorn: famous for one horn, but unforgettable because of it.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** use what you have
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      resourcefulness is a netizen’s virtue. use what you have. repurpose, adapt, and innovate with the tools at hand. unless it’s a floppy disk — then maybe it’s time to upgrade. open source thrives on the idea that good tools are built from what’s available and shared freely.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** use levers, not people
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      use levers, not people. automation, scripts, and tools amplify productivity. people aren’t levers; they’re collaborators. respect their time and energy. build tools that make life easier for everyone.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** release early, release often
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      perfection is the enemy of progress. release early, release often. share your work, gather feedback, and iterate. the open-source world doesn’t reward hoarding half-baked ideas — it thrives on sharing, learning, and improving together.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** distrust all claims for the one true way
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      dogma has no place in open source. distrust all claims for the one true way. there’s always another approach, another tool, another perspective. except for pizza. pizza is always the answer.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** think ahead, but don’t worship your plans
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      planning is crucial, but rigidity is fatal. think ahead, but don’t worship your plans. adapt, evolve, and embrace change. the digital world moves fast, and flexibility keeps you relevant.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** think big: you are the universe
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      you are part of something vast. think big. contribute boldly. expand your horizons. like any good universe, occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just without the big bang.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** abhor violence in all its forms
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      in a realm built on collaboration, abhor violence in all its forms. keep your peace, hold your tongue, and resist the urge to dominate. healthy discourse, not conflict, builds strong communities.
	    </p>
	  </details>
	  <details>
	    <summary>
	      ***** practice the prime directive
	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      respect autonomy. practice the prime directive. let others create, explore, and innovate in their own way. unless you’re in a sci-fi movie — then totally ignore it.

	    <summary>

	    </summary>
	    <p>
	      this credo is a guide to being a netizen who contributes meaningfully to the open-source world. it calls for clarity, integrity, passion, and respect. by living these principles, we don’t just create better software — we create a better digital society. one commit, one conversation, and one collaboration at a time, we build a more open, resilient, and creative world.

	    Here’s a old MIT story: the computer age began with the Tech Model Railroad Club in the late 50’s. Specifically, it started with the folks that worked on the switchgear. When a mainframe came to MIT (the “hulking giant”), these hackers began to hog overnight slots, trying to code with minimum instructions. It became an obsession.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** groceries and a volkswagen
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Such an obsession, in fact, that one hacker took it too far. For three Saturdays on end, his wife went for groceries. Arriving home, she’d ask, “You want to help me bring in the groceries?” His reply? “No.” And then he’d keep tinkering.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    On the fourth Saturday (according to legend), she came home with a packed Volkswagen and asked again. Again he declined, but this time she blew up.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    “What’s wrong with you? Why won’t you help me with the groceries?”
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    “You asked me if I *wanted* to help you bring in the groceries. You didn’t ask me if I *would*.”
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** didn't go to MIT
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Our family was just getting by, so my dad asked me to avoid faraway colleges. As incentive, he got me into coding classes at the local college (at 14) and arranged for me to split high-school and college. Fine by me, and I did okay.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I logged into UNIX for the first time on June 18th, 1974. An avid reader since age 6, text-processing was very much on my mind. When I encountered a system where plain text is the currency, I was hooked.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    But the story about the groceries and the Volkswagen made me think: Computers and humans both depend on language, but unlike computers, human speech conveys an exact meaning even using apparently *imprecise* language. Could the informal UNIX programming rules be adapted to life?
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** ed > vi > emacs
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    I remember my first foo, created with the ``ed`` line editor, in September, 1974. Bill Joy hadn’t even written ``vi`` yet (that watershed weekend was still about three years in the future). It was an amazing experience for a fifteen-year-old.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Fifth edition UNIX had just been licensed to educational institutions at no cost, and since this college was situated squarely in the middle of the military-industrial complex, scoring a Hulking Giant was easy. Finding good code to run it? That was another issue, until Bell Labs offered up a freebie. Something to do with escaping the wrath of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Coding in UNIX was fun. Getting the computer to do things on its own — via ASM and FORTRAN — was not new to me. This was simpler: here was this thing that took away all the complexity: text is data; everything is a file; small is beautiful; do one thing well. Yes, it was cranky and buggy and sometimes dumped you in the bit bucket. But it was powerful and relatively easy to use.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    What made UNIX beautiful to me was abstraction. You didn’t have to worry (much) about the low-level details if you didn’t feel like it. You could focus on logic and abstraction without having to learn too much first. You could take little pieces — like “ls” and “cat” and “awk” and “sed” — and you could assemble a script or a C program that would grant your wish. And that was exhilarating and exciting and fabulous for me.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I got turned onto emacs sometime in the mid-eighties, when I moved to Atlanta to work for HP. A fellow writer there used it, and suggested it might help me write and code up examples more effectively. He was right, and it stuck as my editing platform of choice. But I hadn’t discovered org-mode yet. Either nobody I knew used it, or it hadn’t been invented yet. And to be honest, I kinda went back and forth between vi and emacs, depending on my “mood of the month.”
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** a cabin in the woods
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Eventually, my HP job became a telecommuting-type arrangement, and I moved to my wife’s farm, about an hour outside New Orleans, in the woods. At that time, Internet was still modem-driven out here, so having command-line Linux with emacs on my laptop was a time-saver.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Sometime not long before Katrina hit, I stumbled across org-mode. I’d already used outline mode for some period of time (can’t remember how long), and org-mode seemed like a logical follow-on from there.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    From there, org-mode just grew, and I grew with it. All the features made it easy for me to both do what seemed natural for me, and do things in a way that felt like they supported my principles. Gradually, my other methods of keeping track of things faded away, except for my alarm clock.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Even when smart-phones took off, I was always trying to find some way to send org files over to my phone and use them there. I think I even wrote some lua code in an iPhone wiki app to emulate org-mode with my files, though it was not fully satisfactory.
	  </p>
	  <h2>
	    ***** the UNIX ethos
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    On June 14, 2024, I marked 50 years of using some form of UNIX nearly every day, so it’s no surprise that my personal ethos aligns with some of the UNIX philosophy:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Say what you mean; because telepathy is still in beta testing.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Be choosy with your media, because your brain thinks it’s real. Unless, of course, you’re watching someone paint happy little trees.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention; otherwise, you’ll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just asked for the time.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Do what you love; life’s too short not to ply your craft. Just don’t expect it to pay the bills, unless your craft is printing money.

	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Divide and conquer; because life is essentially a giant game of strategy board games.
	    </li>

	    ***** emacs+termux+android, oh my!
	  </h2>
	  <p>
	    Nowadays I have a floating root directory in a private Git repo, all administered automatically from my .emacs file on any given device. Emacs startup pulls the latest from the repo, copies the (possibly) updated .emacs file to my homedir, rereads it, and starts emacs. Every 10 minutes it does a “save-all” and updates the repo, so I can walk off and leave things running, not worrying about whether I saved them or not.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    And when I do shut down gracefully, it saves all and updates the repo just for good measure. I have a bunch of functions tied to “C-c m …” that do everything from bring up local apps (email, calendar, SMS, etc) to synching my org-roam DB to browsing to God knows what. I’m living in an emacs bubble, guided by org-mode and made to match my flighty personality by heavy customization.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    What’s the other 10%? Wishful thinking. I’m hoping when I die, I go to a mainframe computer room in the sky, with a little office off to the side, with stained green carpet squares and dodgy flourescent lights, a metal desk, a VT-100, and infinite time to play. And a never-empty coffee pot. Who knows?
