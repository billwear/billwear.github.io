      I’m setting out to prove that skill and integrity can inspire others, even when the skill is really a meta-skill. I’ve learned that I can pick up new things quickly, whether they’re academic (calculus), crafty (sewing), design-based (electronics), technical (Emacs), or tools that help me navigate the world (my “ESTJ utility belt,” which you’ll be hearing more about here soon).

Don’t worry—I’m not going to teach you calculus. That’s for a very specific few. But the others? I’ll be:

Learning or improving skills publicly, showing each step along the way.

Cementing that learning by teaching, whether through tutorials, articles, or even books.

I’m not doing this for money, though mastery often finds its own ways to pay. I’m doing it because it’s what I’m built to do. I’ve never believed in limits on intelligence, and I dislike the labels that ignore a person’s willingness and desire to learn alongside their raw “brainpower.”

To that end, I’m rebooting my five main channels:

billwear.github.io — a log of my experiments in learning how to learn.

solderandsignal.com — brushing up my (rusty) EE degrees and sharing the joy of electronics.

the-way-of-emacs.com — my journey from budding guru to true mastery of this strange, powerful beast.

Journal of the Inner Fire (this Substack) — exploring tools for living an INFP life in an ESTJ world.

bohobytebags.com — turning my quest for the perfect backpack into an obsession with sewing craftsmanship.

      No set schedule yet, but I plan to keep them current—now that I have a raison d’être tying these “scattered” projects together. Follow along and join the one(s) that pique your interest.
