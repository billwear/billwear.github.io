        Welcome to the Inner Fire Project:  A constellation of tools, essays, and experiments for the quietly perceptive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I build things for people who think deeply, feel strongly, and prefer to work from the inside out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you'll find my projects -- each different in subject, but rooted in the same approach: curiosity, craftsmanship, and a little quiet rebellion.  
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're someone who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>values meaning over noise,</li>
        <li>enjoys making things your own,</li>
        <li>and likes your tools just a <em>little</em> handmade</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        then you might feel at home here.
      </p>
