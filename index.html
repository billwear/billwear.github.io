  <h1>Hey, I'm Bill Wear.</h1>

  <p>
    I write, I build, I document, I tinker. Sometimes I publish essays about
    <a href="https://williamwear.substack.com">making better decisions</a>.
    Sometimes I help people understand complex systems. Most of the time, I’m just thinking with my hands.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Better to be clear than clever. Better to be kind than right. Better to build than win.”
  </blockquote>
