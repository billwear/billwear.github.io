My name is Bill Wear. I go by the handle <a href="mailto:stormrider.io@proton.me">stormrider</a>. This is my personal website.

<p style=
I have been using Unix for almost 50 years, almost every
day. I have been a software developer in C, C++, Perl, PHP,
Python, and bash. I have been a voracious reader since I was
six years old. I have very often made a very good living as
writer. Currently, I am a technical writer for the MAAS
project at Canonocal. You can learn lots more about me
through my <a href="about.html">geek code</a>.
