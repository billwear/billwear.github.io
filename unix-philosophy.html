            life at the command line
        </p>
<p class="bodytext">
On June 14, 1974, I logged into a UNIX&trade; system for the first time. I was fifteen. It changed my life.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Over those fifty years, the ideas of UNIX became my personal philosophy: principles I aspire to embrace every day of my life. These principles work for me. I couldn't say how useful they are to others, but I know they've taken me to some interesting places, kept me humble in the highs and lifted me up in the lows.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Say what you mean</strong>; because telepathy is still in beta testing.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Be choosy with your media</strong>, because your brain thinks it’s real.
Unless, of course, you’re watching someone paint happy little trees.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention</strong>; otherwise,
you’ll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just asked for the time.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Do what you love</strong>; life’s too short not to ply your craft. Just don’t
expect it to pay the bills, unless your craft is printing money.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Keep it simple</strong>; complex plans involve running, and who’s got the
energy for that?
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Start small and build a little at a time</strong>; a mosaic is more beautiful
than the finest concrete, and way less likely to get you sued for improper construction.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Network</strong>; because who else will laugh at your “I’m not a robot”
jokes?
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Be who you are</strong>; even a bent wire can carry a great light, especially
in a modern art exhibit.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Build for strength, not just speed</strong>; the hare may have had more
Instagram followers, but the tortoise won the race.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Hack</strong>; just remember, “try it and see” doesn’t apply to skydiving or
lion taming.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Under-promise and over-deliver</strong>; because everyone loves a surprise,
especially when it’s not another birthday card.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Divide and conquer</strong>; because life is essentially a giant game of
strategy board games.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Do one thing well</strong>; remember, unicorns are famous for just one horn.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Use what you have</strong>; unless it’s a floppy disk, then maybe it’s time
to upgrade.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Use levers, not people</strong>; because people are terrible at being levers,
they keep asking for coffee breaks.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Release early, release often</strong>; otherwise, you’re just hoarding
half-baked ideas, and there’s no market for those.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Distrust all claims for the one true way</strong>; except for pizza, pizza is
always the answer.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans</strong>; all things are possible,
except maybe skiing through a revolving door.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Think big: you are the universe</strong>. And like any good universe,
remember to occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just
without the big bang.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Abhor violence in all its forms</strong>, even contradicting others. Keep
your peace, hold your tongue, and avoid turning into a debate club mascot.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Practice the Prime Directive</strong>; unless you’re in a sci-fi movie, then completely ignore it.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I don't try to tell others how to live unless they ask. None of us are born the same; why should I?
