Moving my web presence to github pages. No stones thrown at my previous provider; I just want to stop spending so much on hosting.  Here's what you can find on this page ATM:

## Musings

What if many psychological issues are really just bad lessons that have become habits? Suppose I have times when I eat compulsively, or I catch myself wiggling my foot a lot? Are these really signs of a psychiatric disorder, or could it be that I learned to eat from people who routinely ate too much, and I developed a restless foot because I once had a desk that pinched my feet when I sat properly?

Emotional causes seem a little far-fetched to me a lot of the time. I have my moments, but they don't seem related to any particular driving events or moods. I can suffer huge setbacks and not react at all, and I can periods of high productivity and great results, and turn into a virtual bridge troll. The correlation just doesn't seem to be there.

### Hmm

This kinda has some implications. First, it would be really hard to think your way out of behaviours that are not driven by your state of mind, but by the habitual pathways you've laid down in your neurons. Second, pattern interrupts would only work temporarily to stop the behaviours.

It just seems extraordinarily hard to break a habit. Gotta work on this. Everyone refers to "mindfulness" as the cure for, well, nearly everything. I think that's an overloaded term, fraught with Eastern philosophy and the idea of meditation and Zen-ness.  Not sure that's what's required.  This isn't a philosophical shift, but just a shift *in attention*. When I can get myself to eat my own dog food -- to "speak clearly, listen carefully, [and] pay attention" -- it's a lot easier.

We put too much force into doing things, dragging emotion into everything from folding clothes to putting up a tent.  In reality, most things are not that hard, and go much better with a much lighter touch.  We aren't encouraged by the screeniverse to live that way.  Interesting.  I have to focus on integrating this calm, attentive approach in my life; it should make things much better.
