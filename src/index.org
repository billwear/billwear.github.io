* Field Engineer’s Log — Cycle 511.16

Sixteen cycles ago, while returning to the Ardent aboard a service skiff, I crossed an uncharted molecular shear front. I didn’t suffer damage myself, but the skiff’s systems began collapsing in cascading failure: stabilizers drifting out of tune, processors dropping into recursive error states, energy routing degrading cell by cell. Nothing responded to override.

With no hope of rejoining the Ardent, I shifted to Protocol Greyfall: emergency descent to the nearest habitable world. I brought the skiff into a high drift orbit, anchored its position, and transferred to the surface from a sensor-blind vantage point. Whether the craft still holds together is impossible to know; its telemetry dissolved before the jump.

I’ve taken on the identity of a mid-life drifter settling into semi-retirement on a quiet patch of marshland. The locals suspect nothing. Their assumptions are a convenient shield.

** Local Civilization Assessment

This species is resourceful and unevenly advanced — clever with improvisation, clumsy with infrastructure, and shockingly inventive within their constraints. Their identification systems were easy to replicate, and their digital finance protocols, while breakable, are widely trusted among them.

Within two weeks, I secured a farmhouse, enough supplies to operate without raising eyebrows, and a sense of the technological baseline of this region. Their electronics rely on coarse fabrication techniques; their communications run on planetary networks full of noise and redundancy; their tools swing wildly between elegant mechanical simplicity and precarious overdesign.

Still, their creativity is far ahead of their hardware. That’s a pattern worth noting.

** Current Mandate

Cross-Contact Rule Six forbids me from introducing knowledge that would warp this civilization’s natural technological curve. That means anything I reconstruct or analyze from the shear front must be built using only the tools and materials already native to this world.

The data is stored in my own short-term memory — unstable, fading, and irreplaceable — so the only path is slow reconstruction. Careful experiments disguised as hobby work. Small-scale prototypes built from local components. A workshop that looks like a retiree’s pastime from the outside but functions as a covert laboratory.

Eventually, I will find a way to extract meaning from what I witnessed in the shear front. Eventually, I will send it up to anyone still listening.

But until then, I blend in, work quietly, and build what I can. I must also develop independent means, since too much fiddling with their digital currency would introduce astable fluctuations, which would also violate Rule Six. In short, I will have to develop some salable products.

For now, the world believes I’m simply a solitary retiree learning to live beside a swamp.

It’s a good cover. I intend to use it well.

* Field Engineer's Log - Cycle 511.17

This cycle began with unexpected biological drag. Yesterday I participated in one of the locals’ mourning rituals — a complex, deeply felt ceremony honoring a deceased family member. I attempted to share in their post-rite communal meal, but the nutrient profile of their dishes was misjudged. The combination produced a slow metabolic overload that only fully announced itself upon waking.

Cognitive throughput today remains below baseline. Tasks that should thread cleanly are snagging, and internal buffers feel cluttered. I suspect it’s a blend of emotional resonance from the ritual and residual biochemical turbulence from the meal. Fascinating, in a way: this world’s social customs and cuisine both possess effects I did not anticipate.

Despite the drag, the early pressure of reorganization is hard to ignore. The workshop is still half-assembled, my logs exist in too many formats, and the workflow systems I relied on aboard the Ardent have no direct analogs here. I will need to rebuild order gradually, piece by piece, without drawing attention.

But late in the cycle, something unexpected cut through the haze: a software environment the locals call “Emacs.”

On first inspection it appeared primitive — a text system approaching its fiftieth local year. Yet beneath its surface I detected something startlingly familiar: a substrate shaped by a dialect of Lisp nearly compatible with the reactive code engines used in mg civilization’s core systems. The structure is crude and uneven, but the philosophical architecture is unmistakable. Recursive evaluation. Symbolic environments. Functions as fundamental units of expression. It is, in its own way, a relic of a forgotten lineage that parallels our own computational evolution.

The discovery produced a moment of clarity I did not expect on a day like this. With Emacs, I can begin reconstructing fragments of my own toolchain using native materials. I can build editors, analyzers, schedulers, log processors — all in plain sight, disguised as an eccentric retiree tinkering with text files.

This is the first true bright spot since I made landfall.

Tomorrow I begin a structured consolidation of tools and routines — one shelf, one function, one system at a time. If this world has kept even a faint echo of Lisp alive, then I am not as cut off as I feared.

And where there is Lisp, there is hope of rebuilding.

* Monday, 9am: Finally conscious again

I need to dispense with the mg prediliction with precise language; otherwise I'll sound suspiciously foreign.

I'm up again after an extended nap. The locals call it a "food hangover." Note to self to avoid an actual hangover, involving fermented alcohol, which isn't really good for anyone, as near as I can tell. And I need to focus on proteins and fats, and force my system into gluconeogenesis again. The cheap, abundant carbs are definitely not a healthy choice.

Fixing up this farmhouse is good cover, since moderately wealthy retirees (how I'm positioning my false identity) wouldn't leave things in disrepair.

I started a project last week to add electrical plugs underneath the kitchen cabinets. They have very lightly used circuits, which will give me additional power ports. One of their normal circuits won't provide me with enough power to drive all the equipment I'll need. Finishing the job will look natural and normal to the neighbors.

I don't /want/ to do it today, but it's very simple work and I need to get it done, so food hangover or not, time to make it happen.
