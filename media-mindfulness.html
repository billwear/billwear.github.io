        <p class="tagline">How what we watch becomes a part of us</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>A favorite streaming series; social media; news sites: The stories,
      pictures, and videos you take in seem harmless – just passsing the
      time. But if you search your feelings (Luke), you know these things
      affect you: how you think and feel, and more importantly, how you make
      decisions. Even if they seem unreal or ridiculous?</p>
    <p>Media (movies, TV shows, video games, and social media) can be a huge
      part of our lives. It’s easy to spend hours every day staring passively
      at screens, absorbing whatever comes into your mind. But here’s the
      thing: our brains are sponges. No, really, they actually are, basically,
      and they soak up all that stuff, and it shapes our identity, thinking,
      and beliefs.</p>
    <h2>the power of images and stories</h2>
    <p>Our brains react to sounds and images almost as if we having the
      experience ourselves. Ever felt scared during a horror movie, or cheered
      when Superman wins? Our brains can’t always tell the difference between
      what’s real and what’s CGI. These powerful feelings and reactions stay
      with us long after the movie ends.</p>
    <p>The more we see something, the more it becomes a part of us. If we watch
      shows that are always full of violence, we might start to think the
      world is a scarier place than it really is. If we constantly see
      perfect-looking people on social media, we might start to feel bad about
      ourselves, even though we know those pictures are often edited or
      filtered.</p>
    <h2>how media shapes our beliefs</h2>
    <p>It’s not just our emotions that are affected by what we watch—our
      beliefs and values can be shaped by media, too. For example, if we
      always see certain groups of people portrayed in negative ways, we might
      start to believe those stereotypes, even if we know better. Or if we see
      unrealistic images of beauty, we might begin to think that’s how
      everyone should look.</p>
    <p>Even when something seems silly or absurd, it can still have an impact.
      Cartoons, for example, might exaggerate things for laughs, but they can
      also send messages about how people should act or what’s considered
      normal. Over time, these messages can become a part of our own thinking,
      without us even realizing it.</p>
    <h2>being mindful of what we watch</h2>
    <p>So, what can we do about it? The key is to be mindful of what we watch
      and how much time we spend in front of screens. Being mindful means
      paying attention to how media makes us feel and think. If something
      makes us feel bad or seems unrealistic, it’s okay to step away or choose
      something else.</p>
    <p>It’s also important to balance the media we consume. Watching different
      types of shows, reading various kinds of books, and following a mix of
      people on social media can help us see the world in a more balanced way.
      We should choose content that makes us think, teaches us something new,
      or simply makes us feel good.</p>
    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>Media is a powerful tool that can shape who we are and how we see the
      world. By being mindful of what we watch and how it affects us, we can
      make better choices that help us grow in positive ways. Remember, just
      because something is on a screen doesn’t mean it’s real—or that it
      should become a part of who we are.</p>
