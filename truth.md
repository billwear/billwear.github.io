## Truth

For much of my life, I was a casual liar. As a teenager, I was sexually abused by a male teacher at a time when I was very vulnerable. My little sister had just died after a two-year struggle with severe leukemia, my mother had all but lost her mind, my father's addiction to alcohol had taken over his life, and my little brother had to get married at 15 because his girlfriend was pregnant.  This teacher knew my family and exploited the situation, essentially extorting me into doing things I otherwise wouldn't consider.

Shame haunted me for years. Until I was able to publicly confess what had happened, many years later, I was afraid to be myself. I never did the audit trail to decide exactly what drove me to be dishonest, and to be fair, some level of the dishonesty was beyond my conscious control. I misremembered things as vividly as if they had been reality. 

I hated myself for years -- partly for lying, and partly out of shame, but still I continued down this path.

Eventually other boys came forward, and we formed a sort of riot squad that used the full power of the press and the legal system to be heard and acknowledged. It was cathartic. I won't say my lying vanished right away, but it was completely gone within about eight months. Somehow, having gotten the shame of of my system, I felt worthy to speak my truth.

### A culture that demands falsehood

We live in a culture that demands lying, in one form or another. We dare not tell Uncle Ray that we can't stand his famous Brussels Sprouts and don't want to eat them. It's not polite to tell someone the truth when they ask how they look, even though the outfit is horrid to you.  Always put your best foot forward. Try to find a way to say something good about the awful neighbor who died yesterday.

Social media makes this much worse. People put their best foot forward, using one of the many filters designed to make us look like movie stars. Vacation shots, baby and pet pictures, and a stream of milliseconds snapshots paint a very deceptive portrait. And we respond by trying to figure out how to top their story. 

One day, I just had enough. I decided not to lie any more. No stretching the truth, no polite coverups; just the truth as clearly and fairly as I could put it. 

### Everything changed

It has been a rousing success. The people in my life who valued false faces seemed to not be around anymore. People who valued the truth, told as simply and plainly as possible, started to populate my daily reality. I stopped saying I was fine when I wasn't; I admitted what I didn't know without fear; and I never shied away from telling someone the truth when they wanted my opinion.

Suddenly, I had friends again. People listened to my opinion and acted on it. Others complimented me when I did well, and felt comfortable correcting me when I did a poor job. It wasn't at all the horrible ordeal I had imagined. All of the angst I felt over my abuse had gotten conflated with a false undercurrent of bad karma. In short, I was completely open and honest with people, and nothing strange happened. 

Today, when I catch myself feeling the urge to lie, I know to look for the stressor -- the unsaid thing, the buried feeling, the unpopular opinion I'm hoarding -- and immediately rectify the situation. It's actually less difficult than allowing deception to set in.
