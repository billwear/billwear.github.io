# Think different
*ADHD is not a disorder.*

For some people, deep work is a strategy. For others, it is a preference. For a smaller group, it is neither. It is the only way work happens at all.

I am in that third group.

I do not work from hustle, discipline, or raw drive. I can only work from alignment. That is not a stylistic preference. It is a structural necessity. When I ignore it, I do not merely become less productive. I become internally noisy, fragmented, and eventually unreliable to myself.

For people like me, shallow work does not just reduce output; it actually disables the system.
The usual model of the mind

Most people experience a fairly clean division between reason and intuition. Thoughts happen, then feelings intrude, then judgment weighs in. The pieces are separate enough that they can be managed in sequence.

That structure tolerates interruption. It allows multitasking and makes background noise survivable.

My mind does not work that way.

There is no hard wall. There is not even a thin one. Ideas, impulses, emotions, and plans arrive together. And yet, somehow, I function. I build things. I make decisions. I ship work.

For a long time, I assumed this made me unusual. Possibly exceptional.

But if the physicist J. Richard Gott is right, I am probably far more ordinary than I would pridefully like to think. His work rests on a simple assumption: unless you have strong evidence otherwise, you should assume you are not living at a special point in time or experience. Applied to minds instead of centuries, that suggests something humbling. When you notice a pattern in yourself, odds are good many others share it quietly and without language.

So rather than treating this as a personal anomaly, it makes more sense to explain it using ideas people already recognize.

## Id, Ego and Superego (Why Interruption Works for Some)

Most people have heard the classic Freudian trio:

    The id supplies drive: desire, fear, appetite, avoidance.

    The ego manages reality: planning, sequencing, execution.

    The superego supplies rules: values, expectations, “shoulds.”

In simplified form, these are often described as arguing voices. The id wants. The superego judges. The ego mediates and moves forward.

For many people, this arrangement works well enough. The parts are distinct. You can interrupt ego thinking, switch contexts, take new input, and resume without losing the thread. Work can happen amid noise.

That separation creates order, though it also creates friction.

### The Fourth Function: Edge Ego

What the three-part model does not explain well is what happens at moments of uncertainty, identity change, or creative synthesis. Moments where the question is not what should I do, but what wants to happen here.

This is where a fourth function comes into play. I call it the Edge Ego.

The edge ego is not about desire (id), control (ego), or rules (superego). It operates at the boundary between what is known and what is not yet formed. It integrates patterns before they become language.

Here is what that feels like from the inside.

I do not have a single internal dialogue. I have two.

One is familiar: words forming in my head, sentences I can hear and follow. That is ordinary ego thinking.

But just ahead of it, there is something faster.

Thoughts arrive there first not as words, but as compressed concepts, directional pulls, or fleeting images. They move too quickly to catch directly. When I try to focus on them, they vanish. But when I slow down and begin thinking in language, I realize I am translating something that has already passed through.

The words are echoes.

That faster layer is the edge ego. It is not mystical. It is not rare. It is simply operating closer to pattern recognition, before narration and judgment engage.

Most people experience this occasionally. Some rely on it constantly because it simply cannot be suppressed. Those people cannot tolerate fragmentation.

## Why force fails

Discipline assumes the ego is fully in charge and simply needs more pressure.

But when the edge ego is active, pressure creates interference. It’s like trying to build a ceiling antenna loop three inches below live wires: all you get is an ugly, repulsive buzz. Noise drowns signal. Fragmentation replaces integration.

For people like me, repeated resistance is not evidence of laziness. It is evidence of misalignment between the fast integrative layer and the slower managerial layer. Pushing jusr destabilizes the system.

So I work differently.

I build slowly where others rush. I simplify where others optimize. I remove friction instead of adding pressure. From the outside, this can look inefficient. In practice, it is the only way my work holds together.
Coherence Is the output

I value coherence over scale, depth over reach, and durability over speed.

I make things with my hands and my mind: sewn objects, written words, systems that help people feel oriented again. The medium changes. The signal does not.

When I give value freely, it is not bait, but proof. What I sell is rare not because it is scarce, but because it is integrated. It comes from one mind, one aesthetic, one way of seeing.

This is not hustle culture, grind, or self-serving optimization. It’s simply work that depends on integration.

## How to work with this mind

If you recognize the fast layer I have been describing, the goal is not to strengthen it. It is already active.

The goal is to optimize the conditions under which it functions, and to choose a mode of work that matches how active the edge ego is in your mind.

This is where many people go wrong.

They assume there is one correct way to do deep work, usually measured in hours. But the type of deep work you can do depends directly on how dominant the edge ego is.

Cal Newport usefully describes four modes of deep work. Seen through this lens, they are not moral choices. They are compatibility layers.
Matching deep-work modes to edge-ego activity

**Monastic mode** works when the edge ego is quiet or backgrounded.
The problem space is well-defined. Progress is deductive. Long, uninterrupted stretches are possible. This mode collapses when the edge ego is highly active. Instead of clarity, you get overload.

**Bimodal mode** works when the edge ego integrates slowly in the background. Large blocks alternate with ordinary life. Patterns carry across days.

**Rhythmic mode** works when the edge ego is steady but bounded.
Daily 60–90 minute sessions allow depth to accumulate without saturation.

## Journalistic deep work: when the edge ego is highly active

This is the mode most people misunderstand.

Journalistic deep work happens in short, intense pulses: 10, 15, sometimes 20 minutes at a time. It looks shallow from the outside. It is not.

This mode is required when:

- the edge ego is highly active,

- ideas arrive rapidly and pre-verbally,

- insight comes as synthesis rather than deduction,

- and clarity degrades if you stay too long.

In this mode, the work is not maintained, but captured. You enter with a clear surface, translate what arrives, and exit before the signal blurs.

Trying to force 90-minute or multi-hour sessions in this state leads to diminishing returns, confusion, and eventual shutdown. The edge ego floods the system with pattern, but the ego cannot keep translating at that rate.

Short pulses, on the other hand, can produce disproportionate value. Ten aligned minutes can outperform hours of forced concentration because they respect the tempo of integration. This is not about stamina. It is about bandwidth.

For minds like mine, journalistic deep work is not a fallback or a compromise. It is the primary mode. Indeed, it is the only viable mode. It is how rare and coherent results emerge without self-destruction.

Short does not mean shallow. It means precise.

## For you (maybe)

If you're like me, and your mind simply won't be still for long periods of time; if you can't translate all the ideas and concepts and fragments that flow coninuously through your mind for long periods, maybe this advice will help.

It's just drawn from my experience. It isn't a expert psychologist’s viewpoint or some sort of credentialed scientific analysis. It's just lived experience, but maybe it can help

### Translate direction, not answers

The edge ego does not deliver finished ideas. It delivers direction.

That direction may arrive as a pull, an aversion, an image, or a quiet sense of “this next.”

Do not interrogate it. Do not demand explanation. Ask instead: What is the smallest faithful action this suggests?

Your slower ego thinking exists to translate signal into action before it dissipates.

### Use non-parallel lists and maps

Traditional to-do lists assume tasks are linear and comparable. This system of ideas is not.

What works better are branching lists, loosely structured notes, and mind maps where relationships matter more than order.

You are not tracking tasks. You are externalizing a topology and building a morphology in which the possible solutions become obvious.

### Minimize competing signals

The edge ego is fast, but it is not loud. Other streams of ideas drown out the signal:

- Music

- Television

- Doomscrolling

- Background conversations

- Constant notifications 

These other threads all compete for the same bandwidth. This is not a personal weakness. It is ordinary cognition. Silence is not discipline. It is signal-to-noise management.

### Resistance is a design problem

If something repeatedly “should” get done and does not, don’t punish yourself with guilt. To be honest, this is where David Allen's “Getting Things Done” really shines. If you can realize that a project is not something you can do, but something that has to be decomposed into next actions that you absolutely do know how to do, you can beat this.

Assume the path is wrong. Do not escalate with guilt. Redesign restores movement, pressure does not. “Maybe I’m doing it wrong,” is a really good mantra for someone who thinks this way.

### Value first, labels second

Value here emerges from coherence over time. Make things. Document them. Notice what keeps working.

Only then name the offering.

### Protect coherence as capital

Your most valuable resource is not time or discipline. It is coherence. If something fragments you, defer it. If a system drains clarity, simplify it. If a rule silences signal, question it.

And if it constantly holds you back? Give it limits.

## A quick diagnostic: How active is your edge ego?

This is not a personality test. It is a pattern check.

You likely have a highly active edge ego if several of the following are true:

- You often know what to do before you can explain why.

- Ideas arrive as images, moods, or directions, not sentences.

- Long, uninterrupted work sessions exhaust or confuse you.

- Short, focused bursts produce unusually dense output.

- Background noise makes thinking feel physically difficult.

- You resist rigid schedules but thrive with flexible structure.

- Your best days are governed by mind maps.

- You feel blocked not by lack of effort, but by misalignment.

- Forcing yourself to “push through” reliably makes things worse.

If only a few apply, your edge ego is active, but likely situational. If many apply, it is structural.

In that case, your task is not to become more disciplined. It is to stop fighting the mechanism you are already using.

## Ordinary, Not Exceptional

None of this requires believing you are special, neither in the exceptional nor disadvantaged senses.

The more accurate assumption is that this way of thinking is common, but poorly accommodated. The modern environment rewards the effictive handling of routine, mainly because there is no efficient automation solution. The workforce is fragmented into those who produce value and those who reap its rewards.

Some minds tolerate that longer than others. Some minds simply cannot. For those who cannot, doing the hard work quietly, slowly, and with care is not a preference. It is the minimum viable condition for meaningful, rare and valuable work.

The world is loud, fast, and fragmenting. Some people can work anyway. Others must protect coherence, or not function at all.

Knowing how your mind works is enough to begin, enough to continue, and more than enough to thrive. Years ago, Apple Computer had a durable ad campaign, built around the catchphrase, “Think different.” I would reframe that as, “Think differently and make it count.”
