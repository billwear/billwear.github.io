  <h1>powering through</h1>
  <p>
    Today is one of those days.  I'm traveling, currently in the Hague for work meetings.  It's Thursday, and going-home day is Saturday.,  My sinuses started rebelling a little this morning, and i started convincing myself that I was having that "hit-by-a-truck" feeling you sometimes get.  Only two days till I go home, and then two days later I meet with the sinus doctor at 9am to talk about surgery, so I think I can limp along till then.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's just the limping part.  I have some Aleve 275 and some Deflatine (for the inevitable stomach issues associated with drainage). That will have to be good enough. But I don't like limping.  So now what?
  </p>
  <h2>The idea of "powering through"</h2>
  <p>
    I've heard this my whole life: "just power through it."  Never been that easy for me; I usually end up collapsing into my bed at some point during the day, as if napping would help -- mainly, because it does.  Sleep has some value for those who don't feel particularly well, probably because you're not particularly focused on how bad you feel.  In a sense, you're not mentally interfering with what your body is trying to do to heal you, I guess.
  </p>
  <p>
    I dunno, but it is an interesting thing to think about.  As soon as I feel better.
