      <h1>How engineers manage projects and make trade-offs</h1>
      <p class="lede">Engineers juggle constraints like budget, schedule, and performance. Here’s how the trade-off game is actually played.</p>

        <h2>The classic triangle</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>Every project lives under three constraints: <strong>time</strong>, <strong>cost</strong>, and <strong>scope/quality</strong>. “Pick any two,” as the saying goes — engineers spend their lives negotiating the third.</p>

        <h2>How engineers actually manage projects</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Requirements first:</strong> clear, testable “shall” statements form the baseline.</li>
            <li><strong>Break down the work:</strong> decompose into systems, subsystems, and tasks; assign IDs and owners.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate and integrate:</strong> build, test, fix, repeat — don’t wait for perfection to move forward.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous risk scanning:</strong> ask daily, “what can sink us?” and “what’s our mitigation?”</li>
            <li><strong>Verification planning:</strong> decide early how you’ll prove each requirement was met (test, analysis, demo).</li>

        <h2>Real-time trade-offs</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>Projects rarely run in straight lines. Engineers make constant trade-offs under pressure. Typical levers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance vs. cost:</strong> a stronger material might add reliability but wreck the budget.</li>
            <li><strong>Schedule vs. thoroughness:</strong> ship today with known gaps, or delay for a full test cycle?</li>
            <li><strong>Features vs. simplicity:</strong> adding “just one more option” often multiplies integration headaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation vs. proven tech:</strong> bleeding-edge can impress, but also bleed resources.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Tools of the trade</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Checklists & Kanban boards:</strong> keep the team aligned and tasks visible.</li>
            <li><strong>Version control (git, etc.):</strong> every change logged, reversible, traceable.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulations & prototypes:</strong> test early assumptions before committing dollars.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily stand-ups:</strong> short syncs to surface blockers and reprioritize quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Metrics dashboards:</strong> time, burn-down, defect counts, throughput — quantify reality.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Examples of live trade-offs</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <pre><code>Scenario: Thermal system runs hotter than predicted.
Trade-off: Add a fan (cost + noise), or derate performance (schedule impact)?
Decision: Add fan; log requirement deviation; update BOM and test plan.

Scenario: Customer asks for a new feature late.
Trade-off: Include now (delay ship), or push to next release?
Decision: Document as "should" requirement; plan for v2.0.</code></pre>

        <h2>The mindset</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p class="lede">Engineering project management is less about Gantt charts, more about disciplined improvisation. Know your requirements, keep the triangle in view, and make trade-offs explicit — not hidden.</p>
