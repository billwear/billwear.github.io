** Hi, I'm Bill
I hung up my cape a long time ago, left the closet behind, and forgot to look back. Still, some things stick with you, no matter where you go: I stand for [[file:truth.org][truth]], Emacs, and the the Netizen Way.

Being a netizen is more than just being online; it's about contributing meaningfully, connecting authentically, and hacking away at life's puzzles with curiosity and care. It's about sharing what you know, learning from others, and never settling the "one true way."

Emacs is my home base, my Swiss Army knife for navigating code, text, and thought. I've spent years making it *do everything possible* — and when that fails, I make it *do something new*. It's not just a tool; it's a way of thinking, a philosophy of adaptability and leverage.

My truth? It's simple: Say what you mean, start small, and build steadily. Focus on doing one thing at a time and doing it well. When you find a problem, divide it, conquer it, and move forward.  And never interfere in someone else's journey without asking first.

If this resonates, [[mailto:wowear@gmail.com][connect with me]]. Let’s explore, learn, and hack our way forward together.
