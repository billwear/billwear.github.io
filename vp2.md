## **Chapter 2: Understanding Your Visionary Mindset**

Now that you’ve acknowledged your strengths and the areas where realization tends to break down, it’s time to dig deeper into the core of your visionary mindset. Why do you naturally lean toward big ideas, and why does the grind of realization feel so draining? Understanding this is key to finding ways to bridge the gap.

### **Why Your Brain Loves Visionary Thinking**

Visionary thinking is exciting—it’s full of potential, creativity, and exploration. When you’re in the zone, dreaming up new ideas, your brain gets a hit of dopamine. It’s the same chemical that gives you that rush when you finish a great workout or achieve a goal. Visionary thinking **feels** good because it’s stimulating and rewarding.

There’s also a sense of freedom in visionary work. You’re not constrained by the limitations of reality. In your mind, the possibilities are endless. You’re imagining the best-case scenario, unburdened by the practical obstacles that might stand in your way. You get to play with ideas, rearrange possibilities, and stretch your thinking beyond the ordinary. **This is your zone of genius**.

But there’s a flipside to that. The visionary process is so exciting that when you shift into realization mode—where the dopamine hit slows down and reality sets in—it can feel like a letdown. The excitement fades, and the tasks start to feel routine. That’s why you often bounce from one idea to the next, chasing that next high of potential.

### **The Excitement vs. Realization Dilemma**

Realization, in contrast, can feel mundane. It’s repetitive. It’s slow. And for someone with a visionary mindset, it lacks the thrill of imagining what’s possible. You’ve already seen the vision in your head—you’ve lived through the excitement—so now the day-to-day steps feel like a drag.

Let’s face it: there’s a huge difference between *imagining* a finished product and the reality of *building* it.

Here’s an example. Imagine you’re planning to write a book. In your head, you can already see the finished product. You’re picturing the cover, the glowing reviews, and maybe even the interviews where you discuss the amazing ideas inside. You get excited about the influence the book could have, the change it might spark in readers.

But then, you sit down to write. It’s not nearly as thrilling as you imagined. Suddenly, you’re not just a visionary author anymore—you’re someone staring at a blank page, struggling with sentence structure, fighting through revisions. That dopamine rush of creativity is replaced by the slower, sometimes frustrating reality of realization.

This isn’t just true for writing. It applies to any project: business ideas, software development, creative ventures, even personal goals. The vision is exhilarating; the realization feels like work.

And for someone who thrives on *big ideas*, the shift from excitement to the daily grind can feel like hitting a wall.

### **Your Strength: Seeing the Big Picture**

One of the reasons you’re so good at visionary thinking is that you’re naturally drawn to **the big picture**. You can see the whole puzzle before the pieces are even in place. You understand the *why* behind what you’re doing, and you know how each part of a project fits into the larger framework.

This ability to see the big picture is incredibly valuable. It’s what makes you a leader, a strategist, and a creative force. Without people like you, the world would stagnate. Innovation happens because visionaries like you imagine what doesn’t yet exist.

But here’s where things can get tricky. When you’re so focused on the big picture, the smaller, day-to-day details can feel insignificant. You might think, *Why does this little task matter? It’s not what’s going to change the world.* And in some ways, you’re right—no single task will create the massive impact you’re aiming for. But the **cumulative effect** of many small tasks is what leads to big results.

It’s like building a house. You can envision the finished home in all its glory—the beautiful architecture, the spacious rooms, the landscaping. But before you can live in that house, you’ve got to lay the foundation, brick by brick. No one brick changes the house, but without them, the house doesn’t exist.

### **Why You’re Not as Bad at Realization as You Think**

Here’s the thing: **you’re not incapable of realization**. In fact, you’re probably better at it than you give yourself credit for. The issue isn’t that you don’t know how to realize your vision—it’s that realization feels *boring* in comparison to your visionary thinking. 

Think about the times when you’ve actually completed a project. Maybe it was a smaller idea or a part of a larger initiative. You did the work. You followed through. The difference? Either the excitement lasted longer, or you found a way to push through the less exciting parts.

You’re fully capable of realization, but the key is finding a way to **make it feel more engaging** and **more connected to your vision**.

### **The Shift: Realization as a Bridge to Your Vision**

Here’s where we need to make a mental shift. Realization isn’t the enemy of visionary thinking—it’s the **bridge that makes your vision real**. Without realization, your ideas remain ideas, floating in the abstract. Realization is the process of *bringing your ideas to life*.

Think of your visionary mindset like a map. You can see the destination—you know where you want to go. Realization is simply the act of driving the car to get there. Sure, there are bumps in the road, maybe a few detours, but every mile you drive brings you closer to your vision.

When you reframe realization as the essential path to your vision, it becomes less about boring tasks and more about **making progress toward something bigger**. It’s not just about checking off boxes—it’s about moving closer to the destination you’ve mapped out.

### **Shifting from Visionary to Visionary Practitioner**

So how do you begin to shift from a visionary who occasionally realizes projects to a visionary *practitioner*—someone who consistently turns ideas into reality? The goal is not to change who you are, but to refine your approach to realization so that it feels more natural, more engaging, and more connected to your visionary strengths.

Here are three mental shifts you can start making today:

1. **Realization is Part of the Creative Process**  
   You might think of creativity as the spark of an idea, but creativity extends into realization. The process of building something is creative in itself. When you’re in the trenches, problem-solving and adjusting, you’re still being creative. Start seeing realization as an extension of your creative energy, rather than a separate or tedious part of the work.

2. **Celebrate Small Wins**  
   Your brain is wired to seek out excitement, and that’s why realization can feel slow. To counter that, start celebrating smaller victories along the way. Each time you finish a step—no matter how small—acknowledge it. This creates mini dopamine hits throughout the project, keeping you motivated. Finishing a chapter of your book? Celebrate. Pushing out a piece of code? Celebrate. 

3. **Use Your Vision to Fuel Realization**  
   Don’t lose sight of the bigger picture when you’re deep in the weeds of realization. Keep your vision front and center. Create visual reminders—post your goal on the wall, set a background on your computer that represents the finished project, or write a note to yourself about why this project matters. When realization feels draining, reconnect with the vision that started it all.

### **The Visionary’s Realization Toolkit**

As we go through this book, we’ll be building your **realization toolkit**—a set of strategies, mindsets, and systems that will help you consistently bring your ideas to life without losing your visionary spark. But before we dive into specific tools, let’s start with a few simple practices that will immediately help you reframe how you think about realization.

#### **1. Break Projects into “Visionary” and “Practitioner” Phases**

Every project you take on has two phases: the visionary phase and the practitioner phase. You’re naturally great at the visionary phase—this is where you brainstorm, innovate, and map out the possibilities. But once you’ve completed that phase, shift into the practitioner mindset. The practitioner’s job is to take the brilliant ideas from the visionary and implement them.

Think of it as two separate roles you play: first, you’re the visionary, dreaming big. Then, you become the practitioner, methodically working to bring that vision to life. Keep the visionary phase separate from the practitioner phase—when you’re in the practitioner phase, resist the urge to tweak or reimagine the vision.

#### **2. Time-Block for Realization**

One of the reasons realization feels overwhelming is that it often lacks the clear structure that ideas have. To combat this, use **time-blocking**. Dedicate specific blocks of time to realization—set a timer for 30 or 60 minutes where your only goal is to *do the work*. During that time, don’t allow yourself to get distracted by new ideas. The visionary phase will have its time—this is your time to focus on *doing*.

Here’s how to start:
- Look at your weekly schedule and carve out specific blocks of time for realization. Start with 30-minute blocks if you’re new to this practice.
- Assign one or two microtasks to each time block. These are the tasks you’ll focus on during that time, and nothing else.

For example:
- Monday 9:00-

9:30am: Write the first 200 words of Chapter 1.
- Tuesday 3:00-3:30pm: Review and edit Chapter 1 introduction.

When time-blocking becomes part of your routine, realization no longer feels like a decision—it’s simply something you do. And because the tasks are broken into small chunks, it won’t feel overwhelming.

#### **3. Start with Micro-Tasks**

If the thought of realizing a full project feels daunting, break it down into micro-tasks. A micro-task is a small, manageable action that doesn’t take much time but moves you forward. The beauty of micro-tasks is that they’re far less overwhelming and help you build momentum.

**Example**:
Let’s say your big-picture goal is to write a book. Here’s how you might break that down:

1. **Big Picture**: Write a 200-page book.
2. **Milestones**:
   - Complete the outline (1 week).
   - Write the first chapter (2 weeks).
   - Finish the first draft (6 months).
3. **Microtasks for First Milestone (Complete the Outline)**:
   - Brainstorm 10 potential chapter ideas (15 minutes).
   - Write a brief description of each chapter (30 minutes).
   - Organize chapters into a logical flow (30 minutes).

Each of these micro-tasks is small, actionable, and easy to complete, but together, they build momentum toward the bigger milestones.

### **Looking Ahead**

In the next chapter, we’ll dive deeper into the tools and systems you can use to support your visionary mindset while mastering the art of realization. But for now, start with these small shifts in mindset and practice. You’ll find that as you reframe realization as an essential part of your creative process, it will become less of a chore and more of an exciting journey toward bringing your vision to life.

The world needs your ideas—now it’s time to build them.
