	<p class="bodytext">
	  Here’s a old MIT story: the computer age began with the Tech
	  Model Railroad Club in the late 50’s. Specifically, it
	  started with the folks that worked on the switchgear. When a
	  mainframe came to MIT (the “hulking giant”), these hackers
	  began to hog overnight slots, trying to code with minimum
	  instructions. It became an obsession.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  <em>Such</em> an obsession, in fact, that one hacker took it
too far. For three Saturdays on end, his wife went for
groceries. Arriving home, she’d ask, “You want to help me bring in the
groceries?” His reply? “No.” And then he’d keep tinkering.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  On the fourth Saturday (according to legend), she came home
with a packed Volkswagen and asked again. Again he declined, but this
time she blew up.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  “What’s wrong with you? Why won’t you help me with the groceries?”
	</p>

	<p class="bodytext">“You asked me if I *wanted* to help you
	bring in the groceries. You didn’t ask me if I *would*.”</p>
	<h2>
	  i didn’t go to MIT
	</h2>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  Our family was just getting by, so my dad asked me to avoid
faraway colleges. As incentive, he got me into coding classes at the
local college (at 14) and arranged for me to split high-school and
college.  Fine by me, and I did okay.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  I logged into UNIX for the first time on June 18th, 1974 at
6:32pm. An avid reader since age 6, text-processing was very much on
my mind. When I encountered a system where plain text is the currency,
I was hooked.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  But the story about the groceries and the Volkswagen made me
think: Computers and humans both depend on language, but unlike
computers, human speech conveys an exact meaning even using apparently
*imprecise* language. Could the informal UNIX programming rules be
adapted to life?
	</p>
	<h2>
	  ed &gt; vi &gt; emacs
	</h2>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  I remember my first foo, created with the ``ed`` line
editor, in September, 1974. Bill Joy hadn’t even written ``vi`` yet
(that watershed weekend was still about three years in the future). It
was an amazing experience for a fifteen-year-old.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  Fifth edition UNIX had just been licensed to educational
institutions at no cost, and since this college was situated squarely
in the middle of the military-industrial complex, scoring a Hulking
Giant was easy.  Finding good code to run it? That was another issue,
until Bell Labs offered up a freebie. Something to do with escaping
the wrath of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  Coding in UNIX was fun. Getting the computer to do things on
its own — via ASM and FORTRAN — was not new to me. This was simpler:
here was this thing that took away all the complexity: text is data;
everything is a file; small is beautiful; do one thing well. Yes, it
was cranky and buggy and sometimes dumped you in the bit bucket. But
it was powerful and relatively easy to use.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  What made UNIX beautiful to me was abstraction. You didn’t
have to worry (much) about the low-level details if you didn’t feel
like it. You could focus on logic and abstraction without having to
learn too much first.  You could take little pieces — like “ls” and
“cat” and “awk” and “sed” — and you could assemble a script or a C
program that would grant your wish. And that was exhilarating and
exciting and fabulous for me.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  I got turned onto emacs when I moved to Atlanta to work for
HP. A fellow writer there used it, and suggested it might help me
write and code up examples more effectively. He was right, and it
stuck as my editing platform of choice. But I hadn’t discovered
org-mode yet. Either nobody I knew used it, or it hadn’t been invented
yet. And to be honest, I kinda went back and forth between vi and
emacs, depending on my “mood of the month.”
	</p>
	<h2>
	  a cabin in the woods
	</h2>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  Eventually, my HP job became a telecommuting-type
arrangement -- working from home, before "remote" was actually a thing
-- and I moved to my wife’s farm, about an hour outside New Orleans,
in the woods. At that time, Internet was still modem-driven out here,
so having command-line Linux with emacs on my laptop was a time-saver.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  Sometime not long before Katrina hit, I stumbled across
org-mode. I’d already used outline mode for some period of time (can’t
remember how long), and org-mode seemed like a logical follow-on from
there.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	From there, org-mode just grew, and I grew with it. All the
features made it easy for me to both do what seemed natural for me,
and do things in a way that felt like they supported my
principles. Gradually, my other methods of keeping track of things
faded away, except for my alarm clock.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  Even when smart-phones took off, I was always trying to find
some way to send org files over to my phone and use them there. I
think I even wrote some lua code in an iPhone wiki app to emulate
org-mode with my files, though it was not fully satisfactory.
	</p>
	<h2>
	  the UNIX ethos
	</h2>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  On June 14, 2024, I marked 50 years of using some form of
UNIX nearly every day, so it’s no surprise that my personal ethos
aligns with some of the UNIX philosophy:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Say what you mean</strong>;
	  because telepathy is still in beta testing.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Be choosy with your
media</strong>, because your brain thinks it’s real.  Unless, of
course, you’re watching someone paint happy little trees.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Speak clearly, listen
carefully, pay close attention</strong>; otherwise, you’ll end up in a
conversation about quantum physics when you just asked for the
time.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Do what you love</strong>;
life’s too short not to ply your craft. Just don’t expect it to pay
the bills, unless your craft is printing money.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Keep it simple</strong>;
complex plans involve running, and who’s got the energy for
that?</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Start small and build a
little at a time</strong>; a mosaic is more beautiful than the finest
concrete, and way less likely to get you sued for improper
construction.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Network</strong>; because
who else will laugh at your “I’m not a robot” jokes?</p></li>
<li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Be who you are</strong>; even a bent
wire can carry a great light, especially in a modern art
exhibit.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Build for strength, not just
speed</strong>; the hare may have had more Instagram followers, but
the tortoise won the race.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Hack</strong>; just
remember, “try it and see” doesn’t apply to skydiving or lion
taming.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Under-promise and
over-deliver</strong>; because everyone loves a surprise, especially
when it’s not another birthday card.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Divide and conquer</strong>;
because life is essentially a giant game of strategy board
games.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Do one thing well</strong>;
remember, unicorns are famous for just one horn.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Use what you have</strong>;
unless it’s a floppy disk, then maybe it’s time to upgrade.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Use levers, not
people</strong>; because people are terrible at being levers, they
keep asking for coffee breaks.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Release early, release
often</strong>; otherwise, you’re just hoarding half-baked ideas, and
there’s no market for those.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Distrust all claims for the
one true way</strong>; except for pizza, pizza is always the
answer.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Think ahead, but don’t
worship your plans</strong>; all things are possible, except maybe
skiing through a revolving door.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Think big: you are the
universe</strong>. And like any good universe, remember to
occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just without the
big bang.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Abhor violence in all its
forms</strong>, even contradicting others. Keep your peace, hold your
tongue, and avoid turning into a debate club mascot.</p></li>
	  <li><p class="bodytext"><strong>Practice the Prime
Directive</strong>; unless you’re in a sci-fi movie, then totally
ignore it.</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h2>
	  Emacs on Termux on Android (or anywhere) with GitHub
	</h2>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  Nowadays I have a floating root directory in a private repo
on github, all administered automatically from my .emacs file on any
given device.  Emacs startup pulls the latest from the repo, copies
the (possibly) updated .emacs file to my homedir, rereads it, and
starts emacs. Every 10 minutes it does a “save-all” and updates the
repo, so I can walk off and leave things running, not worrying about
whether I saved them or not. And when i do shut down gracefully, it
	  saves all and updates the repo just for good measure.
	</p>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  I have a bunch of functions tied to function keys that do
everything from bring up local apps (email, calendar, SMS, etc) to
synching my org-roam DB to browsing to God knows what. I’m living in
an emacs bubble, guided by org-mode and made to match my flighty
personality by heavy customization of org-roam.
	</p>
	<h2>
	  What’s the other 10%?
	</h2>
	<p class="bodytext">
	  Well, presuming there's an afterlife, I want mine to be a
gigantic mainframe computer room, with a little office off to the
side, with stained green carpet squares and dodgy flourescent lights,
a metal desk, a VT-100, and infinite time to play. And a never-empty
coffee pot. One can hope.
