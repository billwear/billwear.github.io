<p>Here’s a old MIT story: the computer age began with the Tech Model
Railroad Club in the late 50’s. Specifically, it started with the folks
that worked on the switchgear. When a mainframe came to MIT (the
“hulking giant”), these hackers began to hog overnight slots, trying to
code with minimum instructions. It became an obsession.</p>
<section id="groceries-and-a-volkswagen">
<h2>groceries and a Volkswagen<a class="headerlink" href="#groceries-and-a-volkswagen" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p><em>Such</em> an obsession, in fact, that one hacker took it too far. For three
Saturdays on end, his wife went for groceries. Arriving home, she’d ask,
“You want to help me bring in the groceries?” His reply? “No.” And then
he’d keep tinkering.</p>
<p>On the fourth Saturday (according to legend), she came home with a
packed Volkswagen and asked again. Again he declined, but this time she
blew up.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you? Why won’t you help me with the groceries?”</p>
<p>“You asked me if I *wanted* to help you bring in the groceries. You
didn’t ask me if I *would*.”</p>

<section id="i-didn-t-go-to-mit">
<h2>i didn’t go to MIT<a class="headerlink" href="#i-didn-t-go-to-mit" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Our family was just getting by, so my dad asked me to avoid faraway
colleges. As incentive, he got me into coding classes at the local
college (at 14) and arranged for me to split high-school and college.
Fine by me, and I did okay.</p>
<p>I logged into UNIX for the first time on June 18th, 1974. An avid reader
since age 6, text-processing was very much on my mind. When I
encountered a system where plain text is the currency, I was hooked.</p>
<p>But the story about the groceries and the Volkswagen made me think:
Computers and humans both depend on language, but unlike computers,
human speech conveys an exact meaning even using apparently
*imprecise* language. Could the informal UNIX programming rules be
adapted to life?</p>
</section>
<section id="ed-vi-emacs">
<h2>ed &gt; vi &gt; emacs<a class="headerlink" href="#ed-vi-emacs" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>I remember my first foo, created with the ``ed`` line editor, in
September, 1974. Bill Joy hadn’t even written ``vi`` yet (that
watershed weekend was still about three years in the future). It was an
amazing experience for a fifteen-year-old.</p>
<p>Fifth edition UNIX had just been licensed to educational institutions at
no cost, and since this college was situated squarely in the middle of
the military-industrial complex, scoring a Hulking Giant was easy.
Finding good code to run it? That was another issue, until Bell Labs
offered up a freebie. Something to do with escaping the wrath of the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act.</p>
<p>Coding in UNIX was fun. Getting the computer to do things on its own —
via ASM and FORTRAN — was not new to me. This was simpler: here was this
thing that took away all the complexity: text is data; everything is a
file; small is beautiful; do one thing well. Yes, it was cranky and
buggy and sometimes dumped you in the bit bucket. But it was powerful
and relatively easy to use.</p>
<p>What made UNIX beautiful to me was abstraction. You didn’t have to worry
(much) about the low-level details if you didn’t feel like it. You could
focus on logic and abstraction without having to learn too much first.
You could take little pieces — like “ls” and “cat” and “awk” and “sed” —
and you could assemble a script or a C program that would grant your
wish. And that was exhilarating and exciting and fabulous for me.</p>
<p>I got turned onto emacs sometime in the mid-eighties, when I moved to
Atlanta to work for HP. A fellow writer there used it, and suggested it
might help me write and code up examples more effectively. He was right,
and it stuck as my editing platform of choice. But I hadn’t discovered
org-mode yet. Either nobody I knew used it, or it hadn’t been invented
yet. And to be honest, I kinda went back and forth between vi and emacs,
depending on my “mood of the month.”</p>

<section id="cabin-in-the-woods">
<h2>cabin in the woods<a class="headerlink" href="#cabin-in-the-woods" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Eventually, my HP job became a telecommuting-type arrangement, and I
moved to my wife’s farm, about an hour outside New Orleans, in the
woods. At that time, Internet was still modem-driven out here, so having
command-line Linux with emacs on my laptop was a time-saver.</p>
<p>Sometime not long before Katrina hit, I stumbled across org-mode. I’d
already used outline mode for some period of time (can’t remember how
long), and org-mode seemed like a logical follow-on from there.</p>
<p>From there, org-mode just grew, and I grew with it. All the features
made it easy for me to both do what seemed natural for me, and do things
in a way that felt like they supported my principles. Gradually, my
other methods of keeping track of things faded away, except for my alarm
clock.</p>
<p>Even when smart-phones took off, I was always trying to find some way to
send org files over to my phone and use them there. I think I even wrote
some lua code in an iPhone wiki app to emulate org-mode with my files,
though it was not fully satisfactory.</p>

<section id="the-unix-ethos">
<h2>the UNIX ethos<a class="headerlink" href="#the-unix-ethos" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>On June 14, 2024, I marked 50 years of using some form of UNIX nearly
every day, so it’s no surprise that my personal ethos aligns with some
of the UNIX philosophy:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Say what you mean</strong>; because telepathy is still in beta testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be choosy with your media</strong>, because your brain thinks it’s real.
Unless, of course, you’re watching someone paint happy little trees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention</strong>; otherwise,
you’ll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just
asked for the time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do what you love</strong>; life’s too short not to ply your craft. Just
don’t expect it to pay the bills, unless your craft is printing
money.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep it simple</strong>; complex plans involve running, and who’s got the
energy for that?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start small and build a little at a time</strong>; a mosaic is more
beautiful than the finest concrete, and way less likely to get you
sued for improper construction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network</strong>; because who else will laugh at your “I’m not a robot”
jokes?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be who you are</strong>; even a bent wire can carry a great light,
especially in a modern art exhibit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build for strength, not just speed</strong>; the hare may have had more
Instagram followers, but the tortoise won the race.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hack</strong>; just remember, “try it and see” doesn’t apply to skydiving
or lion taming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Under-promise and over-deliver</strong>; because everyone loves a
surprise, especially when it’s not another birthday card.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Divide and conquer</strong>; because life is essentially a giant game of
strategy board games.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do one thing well</strong>; remember, unicorns are famous for just one
horn.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use what you have</strong>; unless it’s a floppy disk, then maybe it’s
time to upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use levers, not people</strong>; because people are terrible at being
levers, they keep asking for coffee breaks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Release early, release often</strong>; otherwise, you’re just hoarding
half-baked ideas, and there’s no market for those.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distrust all claims for the one true way</strong>; except for pizza, pizza
is always the answer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans</strong>; all things are
possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think big: you are the universe</strong>. And like any good universe,
remember to occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just
without the big bang.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abhor violence in all its forms</strong>, even contradicting others. Keep
your peace, hold your tongue, and avoid turning into a debate club
mascot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practice the Prime Directive</strong>; unless you’re in a sci-fi movie,
then totally ignore it.</p></li>

<h2>Emacs on Termux on Android (or anywhere) with GitLab<a class="headerlink" href="#emacs-on-termux-on-android-or-anywhere-with-gitlab" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Nowadays I have a floating root directory in a private repo on gitlab,
all administered automatically from my .emacs file on any given device.
Emacs startup pulls the latest from the repo, copies the (possibly)
updated .emacs file to my homedir, rereads it, and starts emacs. Every
10 minutes it does a “save-all” and updates the repo, so I can walk off
and leave things running, not worrying about whether I saved them or
not. And when i do shut down gracefully, it saves all and updates the
repo just for good measure. I have a bunch of functions tied to “C-c m
…” that do everything from bring up local apps (email, calendar, SMS,
etc) to synching my org-roam DB to browsing to God knows what. I’m
living in an emacs bubble, guided by org-mode and made to match my
flighty personality by heavy customization of org-roam.</p>

<p>Wishful thinking? I dunno, I’m hoping when I die, I go to a mainframe
computer room in the sky, with a little office off to the side, with
stained green carpet squares and dodgy flourescent lights, a metal desk,
a VT-100, and infinite time to play. And a never-empty coffee pot. Who
knows?</p>
