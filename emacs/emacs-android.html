<h1>EMACS on Android<a class="headerlink" href="#emacs-on-android" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>so I’m a big fan of the organic style of doing stuff, that is, just
start where you are and see where it goes. that’s what I’m doing here.
first, I need to be able to run emacs on my Android phone. there are
certainly more options than these that I considered: * ssh into a
rented server someplace, like Digital Ocean. did this for awhile, but
requires me to be online, and costs money every month. -1. * there’s an
emacs native app for android, but it seems like it’s not ready for prime
time yet. -1. * termux on Android with the emacs pkg installed. termux
has a dropbox api I can already use to back up files. +1. I know there
are more. I don’t care at this point, analysis paralysis ain’t my thing.
# emacs on termux on Android, oh my (had to be done, sorry). so I
started with: ```bash pkg install emacs ``` then I fired up emacs:
![Screenshot_20240528_150835_Termux.jpg](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/billwear/billwear.github.io/assets/18288776/abfef089-88f1-4d0b-953c-0076e105b47d">https://github.com/billwear/billwear.github.io/assets/18288776/abfef089-88f1-4d0b-953c-0076e105b47d</a>)
nevermind that my extra keys look like this:
![Screenshot_20240528_151849_Termux.jpg](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/billwear/billwear.github.io/assets/18288776/c3e58cc2-3233-46c3-9671-0f180cbee088">https://github.com/billwear/billwear.github.io/assets/18288776/c3e58cc2-3233-46c3-9671-0f180cbee088</a>)
I’ll just deal with Ctrl keys until I get tired of them or adapt. I’m
betting on adapt. so let’s get started with emacs, yeah! ## foo.org as I
write this, I’m on vacation after a long overseas engineering meeting
that my company puts on every six months. just seemed like the time. I
have a few days, and I have emacs with org mode. let’s redesign
everything at once, what the heck. I open up a file called “foo.org” in
the default termux directory (whatever, for now, anyway). might as well
use org mode to do some personal timing studies for 2-3 days and see if
there’s anything I should change: ```bash * emacs * hygiene * meds
* reno * dressing * my cat * my wife * family * … ``` then,
since I was working on emacs, I started the org clock (C-c C-x C-t) to
keep time. for those who haven’t used this before, it creates a log book
for the org outline item, with a clock entry, like this: ```bash *
emacs :LOGBOOK: CLOCK: [2024-05-24 Fri 14:07] :END: ``` *[learn more
about the org clock](<a class="reference external" href="https://orgmode.org/manual/The-clock-table.html)*">https://orgmode.org/manual/The-clock-table.html)*</a>
and off I went. ## some words about time studies at certain points in my
life, I used to think of myself as the “quintessential” engineer, which
is kinda lame, since that “q” word only became a real word when I was,
like, 20. anyway, I would get this idea that I could track all my time
and then get really efficient and better. there are a couple of issues
with this. first, it takes a lot of overhead to track your time. second,
you get in the flow of things and forget to clock out of task one and
into task two. so I eventually decided that I only need to do this from
time to time, when I feel like I’m out of balance. iow, don’t try this
at home. ## things I learned I love to sit with my cat in my lap late at
night, and it’s very important to her, also. she mostly just sleeps, but
every one on awhile she reaches up and grabs my t-shirt, asking for
pets. I’m usually holding my phone in one hand, scrolling social media,
so it’s easy to Multitasking. we recently bought an old house (my wife’s
grandmother’s house, a quarter mile away on the 80 acres where most of
the family lives). we’re trying to renovate it so we can get into it.
that’s kinda a britcom of it’s own, but it consumes most early evenings,
Saturdays, and days off. so I set aside all hope of meaningful hobbies
until we’re moved in and done renovating. big mistake. I can still do a
lot of my hobbies from my phone, especially since I had no clue how much
time I was vegetating every night. +1 also, I wasn’t being particularly
careful about my sleep. I’d go to bed whenever, get up late, rush thru
getting ready, and watch the trash and laundry and scattered stuff build
up until I just had to stop and do it. I can adjust my bedtime just a
little, get up just a little earlier, and do housework at lunchtime. +1
and finally, I can put an evening cap on the reno at about 8:15-8:30pm.
that means my 84yo FIL who loves renovation won’t wear himself out, and
we get some balance back in our lives. +1 ftr, here’s the clocktable
that got me to this point: ```bash * clocktable #+BEGIN: clocktable
:scope file :maxlevel 1 #+CAPTION: Clock summary at [2024-05-26 Sun
18:50] | Headline | Time | |————–+———–| | *Total
time* | *3d 3:25* | |————–+———–| | birdie’s |
10:19 | | family | 6:44 | | baby | 6:11 | | social media | 4:14
| | insomnia | 3:01 | | eating | 2:02 | | church | 2:17 | |
sharan | 2:19 | | prep | 1:13 | | sleeping | 1d 7:33 | | time
mgmt | 1:16 | | waking up | 1:40 | | emacs | 0:53 | | hygiene
| 0:39 | | housework | 0:41 | | journaling | 0:20 | | planning
| 0:03 | #+END: ``` in the spirit of my earlier warning, notice that
time management is really high for a three-day span. you can’t track
time very often without getting a distorted picture. ## revelations
about emacs on Android it may not seem like much, but I learned a few
things about using emacs on Android: * I wasn’t using the interface
properly. I started out using the standard emacs control keys to move
the cursor, and it was slow and error-prone. then I got a bright idea:
I’ll add the termux arrow keys to the extra keys! faster, and has
autorepeat, but still error prone. then it hit me that I could just
place point with my finger. then I started learning all sorts of touch
movements that termux supports (and by extension, emacs on termux). a
whole bunch of dominoes fell when I figured this out. * I have some
(good?) habits, like saving every so often or recentering the text.
Control sequences aren’t as efficient on the phone as they are on a
keyboard, although it’ll be nice to have normal pinkies again. Also,
termux doesn’t recognize the ```Shift``` key in the same way that a
laptop does. I customized the termux extra keys by adding function keys
and assigning frequently-used keystrokes, like this: ```bash
(global-set-key (kbd “”) ‘org-agenda-list) (global-set-key (kbd “C-“)
‘org-demote-subtree) (global-set-key (kbd “M-”) ‘org-promote-subtree)
(global-set-key (kbd “C-x “) ‘org-cycle-global) (global-set-key (kbd “”)
‘delete-other-windows) (global-set-key (kbd “C-”) ‘balance-windows)
(global-set-key (kbd “M-”) ‘split-window-below) (global-set-key (kbd
“C-x “) ‘split-window-right) (global-set-key (kbd “”) ‘save-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd “C-”) ‘find-file) ``` I also modified the termux
extra keys to give me a head start at collapsing keystrokes: ```bash
extra-keys =
[[‘ESC’,’CTRL’,’ALT’,’TAB’,’/’,’-‘,’HOME’,’END’],[‘F1’,’F2’,’F3’,’F4’,’F5’,’F6’,’F7’,’F8’,’F9’,’F10’,’F11’,’F12’]]
``` the resultant extra-key bar looks like this:
![Screenshot_20240528_163213_Termux.jpg](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/billwear/billwear.github.io/assets/18288776/4d236c77-be87-4259-a83e-b178a48f2c87">https://github.com/billwear/billwear.github.io/assets/18288776/4d236c77-be87-4259-a83e-b178a48f2c87</a>)
* I also discovered that the menu bar on emacs on termux is useless,
because off-by-one error, and text selection needs a shortcut method
better than ```bash C-a C-spacebar C-u- C-n or C-p to correct location
miss the Ctrl key and start over ``` but I don’t have a good fix yet.</p>
