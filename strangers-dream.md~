# Stranger's Dream

Gotta scrub my language.  Too clean and lab-grade, out here, it tags you as the wrong kind of strange.  Locals listen for that stuff -- the sterile edges, the precision.  Does you know good.  Gets you flagged before you even know they're listening.

So I killed the morning reading *Neuromancer*, by someone named William Gibson.  He must have had a hard life.  Feels less like reading and more like being rewired by a stranger's dream.
