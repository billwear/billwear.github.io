## Wed, Nov 5, 2025
Third weekday of my new retirement life. This week is not as productive as I'd like, mostly because the time change ("fall back") has thrown me off a bit. I'm rolling with it.

### 08:55 Still, a good start
I woke from vivid dreams I can't remember clearly, tho there was a food theme.

As always, I fed the cat and made some tea, then curled back up under the covers to write my [substack](https://williamwear.substack.com/). Today was extra productive: I wrote a note to this effect:

> Some of my posts don’t garner many views. I used to worry and look for “the formula.” Then, a few days ago, someone DM’d me about one of the weaker ones: “You always seem to know just what I need to hear when I’m depressed: this one really lifted me.” It’s humbling to be reminded why I’m doing this.

Feeling enlivened and ambitious, I penned a post completely freehand (aka, no soak time revisions), about why [you're never too old](https://open.substack.com/pub/williamwear/p/youre-never-too-old?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=5l1qei).

Now I'm lying in bed still, swilling cold tea and cuddling the cat. And considering a revelation of the early waking moments: I should wait to start posting to my maker websites until I've got a little more progress in the making. Hmm.

## Thin wispy clouds, sunny and cold
The dollar-store clock on the wall regulates my heartbeat while I lie here, using the cat to excuse my laziness. A sneeze. A sigh.

Over the last two days, I've washed all my laundry, as well as half a footlocker of old sewing material I inherited from my mother-in-law. Lots of different whimsical fabrics, for which I currently have no idea. And a ton of corduroy, which gave me the idea to make theme purses, backpacks, phone cases, or even baby blankets around the designs:

* Corderroneous: Corduroy fabric daypack in a quilted pattern of odd wale angles and semi-incompatible colors.

* Scrummage: Rugby shirt material made into a big sling bag.

        ![scrummage](img/scrummage.jpg)

* Plaiditude: a boxy purse made from plaid with boxy attitude.

        ![plaiditude](img/plaiditude.jpg)

* Tartangular: an odd little purse from tartan material on a slant.

        ![tartangular](img/tartangular.jpg)

* Florlorn: a laptop bag using a failed attempt at a dress from floral upholstery material.

        ![florlorn](img/florlorn.jpg)

* Couchure: a boho crossbody bag made from fairly obnoxious faux-floral, shoulda-been-but-isn't-upholstery material.

        ![couchure](img/couchure.jpg)

* Subdueful: a small, inconspicuous purse made from, well, small, inconspicuous material.

        ![subduful](img/subdueful.jpg)

* Stitchuation: a larger purse made from somebody's really weird idea of a pair of ladies pants.

        ![stitchuation](img/stitchuation.jpg)

* Aubergenius: a complete kit (phone sling, backpack, purse, et al) made from bias pinstribed aubergine material.

        ![aubergenius](img/aubergenius.jpg)

* Normecoreum: another complete kit, in a more casual boho style, made from this comfy but foregettable fabric-that-looks-like-bad-linoleum.

        ![normecoreum](img/normcoreum.jpg)

* Botanomaly: let's make a sling bag from this doesn't-quite-fit-any-category fabric print.

        ![botanomaly](img/botanomaly.jpg)

* Fishin Statement: a beach bag covered in weird-looking fish.

        ![fishin-statement](img/fishin-statement.jpg)

* Biasic Park: a small purse with many pockets, shaped a lot like a T-Rex.

        ![biasic-park](img/biasic-park.jpg)

* Suedegeist: a larger daypack with this eclectic-electric brown suede.  Don't step on it.

Don't worry, if this wasn't enough, there's (apparently) much more of this potluck available.

## 17:15 a decent day of sewing stuff & odd things

Did a bit of prep work on the kitchen under-cabinet plugs.  They are modular plugs that I'm putting into small enclosures that hide underneath the cabinet.

### Repurposing modular plugs

I made holes for the modular plugs (on the front) and the wires to exit (on the back) using a plastic-cutting tip on my soldering iron.  The plugs have little clips to help hold them into the enclosures that you can buy for them, which were too big for the application.

I cut the holes and used a dremel tool to thin out the material, so the clips will catch, but they don't catch all that well, so I used some heavy caulk to seal them into place.  I put a second coat of caulk on today, just to be sure.  The first coat was holding the plugs well enough to push and pull plugs, but I want to be absolutely sure.

### Brew-hemian Rhapsody

The rest of the day so far has been spent on my coffee-themed quilt, which I'm calling "Brew-Hemian Rhapsody."  The center stripe (already sewn) is 6-inch squares.

Everything else is four-inch squares,

with two 2"x4" rectangles moving randomly down the line to make it big enough:

I'm making the most of material I already have.

At the moment, I'm eating salted brown butter cookie ice cream and chilling.  Maybe more will get done later.
