<h1>adversarial beginnings<a class="headerlink" href="#adversarial-beginnings" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>If you’re going to learn a new language, it’s probably important to get
an idea of the culture. After all, culture defines the vocabulary and
the level of abstraction of a country’s language. Certainly that’s true
of networking.</p>
<p>Computer networks began largely because of the ways humans segregate
their sharing, not out of a desire to share freely.  TCP/IP – and a
lot of its underlying structure – evolved to meet a specific need:
how can we keep a computer network functioning in the event of a
nuclear war? When nodes go offline, randomly, how can surviving nodes
keep the communication going? If Boise is destroyed, how can we still
communicate with Seattle? Wiping out Kansas should not imply that we
can’t connect with Nebraska. Gruesome beginnings, indeed.</p>
<p>Over time, though, those same TCP/IP networks evolved to meet a less
bellicose need: How can we keep a network functioning efficiently if
some of the paths are bottle-necked or even out-of-service? Well, the
answer is, “build the ARPAnet” – now called the Internet – which
relies heavily on TCP/IP networks. The OSI model underlying TCP/IP can
adapt to changing loads, handle significant failures, and strictly
limit the network “blast radius” (yes, sadly, that’s what it’s called)
when things go wrong. TCP/IP networks distil the core of human sharing
into (arguably) a much simpler and more predictable form.</p>
<p>Happily, the threat of nuclear war has dropped off substantially in
the meantime, though it sometimes raises an ugly eyebrow. Also
happily, the TCP/IP network has survived even the loss of its original
purpose. This tutorial is about the surviving network. Full
disclosure: I used to work in the WMD industry, but one day, I walked
away and chose to promote sharing with other humans, instead of
dividing and cloistering them. And I changed my official term for
network failures from “blast radius” to “cone of silence” (CoS),
probably my happiest choice of all.</p>
<section id="focusing-on-architecture">
<h2>focusing on architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#focusing-on-architecture" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>With complicated subjects, it’s always hard to know where to start.
There’s a huge chicken-and-egg problem with TCP/IP when trying to define
terms. I prefer to take Isaac Newton’s approach to physics, as he did in
the Principia – create some definitions that start from common things
we’re all likely to understand. For example, Newton begins with mass;
slightly paraphrasing his definition: - The quantity of matter is
defined as the density of that matter and the volume that it takes up,
conjointly. In other words, m = ρ x V, or “mass equals density times
volume”. That doesn’t seem like much, but it’s an astounding starting
point. Hint: If you haven’t read an English translation of the Principia
(it’s natively in Latin), you should take the time out to do so: it’ll
change your understanding. Anyway, back to our story.</p>
<section id="network-architecture">
<h3>Network architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#network-architecture" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>It’s very easy to just dive in, of course, and some fair percentage of
my readers will get what I’m saying, but that isn’t good enough for this
tutorial. Instead, imagine two computers, “SanDiego” and “Bangor”,
located at opposite corners of the country. They want to communicate via
available networks. How do they do it? Well, we could just hook up a
wire between SanDiego and Bangor. People probably did that, at one
point, back in the day. It might have even worked, until someone with a
backhoe cut a cable. No problem! We’ll just use two wires. Surely we can
get the first one fixed before somebody cuts the second one, right?</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t take long to figure out that messages are
getting lost and garbled. After all, it’s a long wire, which has lots
of impedance. Some signals will disappear into the noise long before
they get there. No problem! We’ll just build repeaters, little boxes
that read the incoming signal and duplicate it at full voltage on the
outgoing line: (Forgive the weird choice of cities, but I’m trying to
work from memory here.) And if memory serves, leasing this space all
over the country to add repeaters – especially at military bases like
Redstone (Huntsville), Fort Hood, and Point Mugu – can get really
expensive, really fast.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-aac-network-model">
<h3>The AAC network model<a class="headerlink" href="#the-aac-network-model" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>By far a much easier way is to create and use the Internet. As the
Internet became “the network”, it evolved into what some call the
“access-aggregation-core” network. In the AAC model, SanDiego sends a
message, labelled for Bangor, to some router on the Internet (which one
doesn’t matter so much). If this router doesn’t know where Bangor is, it
just sends it on to another router, until the message finds a router
that knows where to forward the message: Theoretically, this works
great, but from a practical standpoint, there are “short circuits” all
over this network: These “sideways paths” are there mostly for
performance reasons, like latency, redundancy, and so on. Sometimes
they’re there because someone can get a better deal, so the reasoning is
financial, too.</p>
<p>Later on in this tutorial, we’ll talk about some of these issues –
and why network architectures have evolved. For now, though, let’s
just say that they have evolved to a more monochromatic design known
at the Clos architecture: This more scalable architecture can
basically use the same switch for everything. There are leaf switches,
known as “top of rack” (TOR) switches, and spine switches. As I’ve
ghosted into the diagram, you scale horizontally by adding more racks,
and vertically by adding more levels of spine switches. This
architectural model is more economical to scale, so it discourages
these little “side bets” that plagued the early Internet.</p>

<section id="yesterday-s-phone-network-is-today-s-internet">
<h3>Yesterday’s phone network is today’s Internet<a class="headerlink" href="#yesterday-s-phone-network-is-today-s-internet" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>When learning a language, it also helps to get into some of the
history of the people who speak that language. For instance, you may
have noticed that a lot of Cajuns – who live in the humid swamps of
the southern United States – often build houses in a unique way. They
build a very sloped main roof, surrounding the house with a
somewhat-elevated, wraparound porch. To be honest, this design makes
*no* sense for a people living in “hurricane alley”. They’d be
better off building houses out of concrete block, with a metal and
concrete roof tied to the base with welded steel girders, and small
windows instead of French doors.  But they don’t, because of their
*history*. The word “Cajun” is a lazy contraction of *Acadian*,
the people who lived in Acadia, or “New France” in the 17th and 18th
centuries.</p>
<p>If you look it up, you’ll find that Acadia included New Brunswick,
Maine, and lots of Canadian maritime islands. They built houses with
high-pitched roofs, with wraparound porches, so that the heavy *snow
load* of winter would slide down the sloped roof, scoot off the porch
roof, and land in the yard. This gave them a clear outside area to
take care of outside business, such as chopping wood or skinning
animals, without having to wade through the snow.</p>
<p>As a homework assignment, you can Google how the Acadians got to South
Louisiana and South Mississippi; Wikipedia is largely accurate, if
local folklore means anything.</p>
<section id="reusing-what-already-works">
<h4>Reusing what already works<a class="headerlink" href="#reusing-what-already-works" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>In the same way, most of today’s modern networking is just a direct
translation of the landline telephone system – [the “Plain Old
Telephone Service
(POTS)](<a class="reference external" href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/plain-old-telephone-service-pots/">https://networkencyclopedia.com/plain-old-telephone-service-pots/</a>)”
– into the digital space. Network switching is really just an outgrowth
of crossbar, which is how local phone calls were “switched” or “routed”
to the correct telephone line.</p>
<p>In most cases, every number dialled closed one more relay, with all
seven relays making a connection to the target phone line. Small
exchanges often “swallowed” dialled digits. For example, if every
local phone number had the exchange “881”, those numbers wouldn’t
trigger any relays beyond just sending the call to the “881”
frameset. In some small exchanges, it wasn’t even necessary to dial
the exchange, just the four digits of the phone number, if the caller
had the same exchange. My grandparents had such an arrangement for
many years, as did my partner’s parents. Essentially, these “shorthand
numbers” were the early *subnets*.</p>
</section>
<section id="long-distance-and-t1">
<h4>Long distance and T1<a class="headerlink" href="#long-distance-and-t1" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>In order to maintain call quality, the very early telephone system
(about 1908) began to use repeaters and loading coils. A repeater
receives a signal and regenerates a new signal of the same frequency,
raising the signal back to the same power level. A loading coil adds
inductance to the line, which resists changes in current, keeping the
transmitted waveform more stable, that is, reducing the distortion
introduced by the impedance of the long wires.</p>
<p>The next evolution, T1 lines, couldn’t compete with today’s fibre
connections, but they did provide a speedy (at the time) 1.5Mbps
connection. For example, in the oil and gas industry of the early
1990s, many of the city offices in New Orleans had wall after wall of
T1 lines wired directly into the building, so that they could get
high-speed data from the offshore oil platforms just a few miles
away. T1 wasn’t originally designed for network traffic. The idea was
to multiplex phone calls on one line via Time-Division
Multiplexing. TDM split up the call traffic into little *digital*
packets that were sent on a rotating basis.</p>
<p>The first T1 lines, which showed up around 1962, could handle about 24
calls without the average telephone user noticing. Telephone linemen,
on the other hand, could usually tell by the “clipped” nature of the
call, as there is a distinctive flatness to the conversation over a
digital TDM circuit.</p>
<p>My first real job was telephone lineman, so I can attest to this
“flatness”. In fact, I recall an actual training session in which we
listened to the same call on two different lines in stereo
headphones. In one ear, we heard the T1 call; in the other, the analog
output of the same conversation. Listening to them in stereo, in sync,
made it easy to learn the subtle differences. The real point is that
these “little digital packets” formed the model for the *packet
networking* we have today.</p>
