<h1>the transport layer<a class="headerlink" href="#the-transport-layer" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Layer 4 brings us to protocols implemented only by the end hosts (i.e.,
not by the routers or other switching gear that connect the network).
This layer handles things like redundancy, confirmed delivery, managing
packets on an unreliable network, and so forth. This is the last layer
that TCP/IP has anything to say about; layers above this are unique to
specific applications. Troubleshooting this level would involve knowing
about entire protocol sets, like UDP or TCP.</p>
<p>If the Internet Protocol (IP) is connectionless, the transport layer
is all about connections.  The transport-layer protocol in use –
we’ll talk exclusively about Transmission Control Protocol or TCP here
– the L4 protocol is the last place in the stack where the entire
message exists in one piece. L4 breaks up larger messages into
segments. Each segment gets a TCP header, and gets passed on to L3
where it becomes an IP packet.</p>
<section id="tcp-transmission-control-protocol">
<h2>TCP: transmission control protocol<a class="headerlink" href="#tcp-transmission-control-protocol" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>I mentioned above the Layer 4 is all about connections, but the
situation’s not always that simple. UDP, for example does not have any
mechanisms for delivering data reliably. I have a t-shirt that says,
“I’d tell you a joke about UDP, but you might not get it.” The pun turns
on the fact that UDP is sort of a <em>fire and forget</em> protocol.</p>
<p>The problem of making sure the message got delivered is as old as
time.  There are many logic problems that involve an army sending a
message between battalions, indicating the time of a planned
attack. But if the messenger has to sneak through enemy lines to
deliver it, how do we know it got there?</p>
<p>Error-correcting codes help, but at the end of the day, nothing beats
the Automatic Repeat Request, cleverly abbreviated <strong>ARQ</strong>. ARQ simply
means we keep sending the message until we know for sure it got there,
intact. We need two mechanisms in order to make this work: an ACK (I
got the message) and a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). If the message
gets there, and it passes the CRC, an ACK is sent.</p>
<p>Returning to the sneaky messenger, what if the messenger got there and
delivered the message, but didn’t get back to tell the sender that the
message got through? That’s a more complicated problem. In the
networking world, we deal with that by waiting a set amount of time
for an ACK before re-sending: The recipient has to know how to deal
with duplicate messages.</p>
<p>How long do we want? That’s a really complex topic called “timeout and
re-transmission”, and I’m going to skip over that here. You can find a
lot of great sources in Google that will help you with that. The most
important things to take away from timeouts, though, are that (1)
messages may arrive out of order, so the ACK signal needs to be tagged
with the ID of the message received, and (2) the recipient has to be
able to reassemble the messages in the correct order.</p>
<p>Oh, and there has to be a limit on how many unacknowledged messages a
sender is willing to leave hanging. If the sender sends three messages
and gets no ACKs, it might not send out sequence number four until the
other end catches up. This number of outstanding, unacknowledged
messages is called a “sliding window”. If the sliding window is three
messages, and number four hasn’t been acknowledged, number 8 won’t be
sent yet.</p>
<p>Sometimes it helps to think of it like jelly beans in a jar with a
small opening; only three or four jelly beans can pop through the
mouth of the jar at any given time – the rest will have to wait. One
falls out, another one gets to the edge of the jar, and the whole
muddle of beans moves one bean closer to freedom.</p>
<p>Okay, weird, but it does help sometimes. The simplest way to envision
how it works, is, well, to actually look at how it works, hence the
next section on the TCP header.</p>
<section id="the-tcp-header">
<h3>the TCP header<a class="headerlink" href="#the-tcp-header" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Here’s a diagram of the L4-to-L3 hand-off: We can get a pretty good idea
what happens at Layer 4 just by decoding the contents of the TCP header.
It contains the following fields:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Source port: the application port number of the host sending the
data. For example, if this is an FTP message, the source port would
probably be 21.</p></li>
<li><p>Destination port: the port number of the application requested on
the destination host. If this is FTP, again this port would likely
be 21.</p></li>
<li><p>Sequence number: the sequence number of this segment of data, to
help the other end put the data back together in the correct order,
as well as help Level 4 on the receiving end know whether a
packet’s been dropped or lost. This handles the fact that segments
don’t necessarily arrive in order.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledgement number: essentially, the next sequence number the
destination host is expecting; used to “gate” packets through the
connection. This is a smart way to ACK packets so that the
recipient knows which messages have been received.</p></li>
<li><p>TCP header length: given to know where the data begins.</p></li>
<li><p>Reserved: reserved for future use, basically; currently always set
to 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Code bits: essentially a set of flags; see the list below.</p></li>
<li><p>Window: used to negotiate the “window” size, that is, how many
bytes the destination host is willing to receive at once; this
allows for the most efficient transmission possible, based on the
characteristics of the two communicating hosts. This is the sliding
window that defines how many messages can be sent (but not
acknowledged) before the sender pauses. The “negotiable” part is
what makes for efficient networks: the sender and receiver can
quickly get to know each other and know how many messages they can
“trust” to be delivered without an ACK.</p></li>
<li><p>Checksum (CRC): used to check the integrity of the segment.</p></li>
<li><p>Urgent pointer: data byte count where urgent data ends; used if the
urgent flag is set (see below). The code bits can indicate the
following things:</p></li>
<li><p>URG: indicates that the urgent pointer field is meaningful, used to
prioritise this message over other messages.</p></li>
<li><p>ACK: used to acknowledge successful delivery of the previous
segment.</p></li>
<li><p>PSH: push notification; tells the receiving host the message is
complete, you can push the data to the application.</p></li>
<li><p>RST: request a connection reset when the error level reaches a
certain threshold; basically, “let’s try that again from the top.”
This is considered an abnormal termination of the TCP connection.</p></li>
<li><p>SYN: used for a three-way TCP handshake; this handshake is how
sender and receiver sync up; it serves a purpose similar to the
preamble in a MAC frame, but at a different level of
synchronisation.</p></li>
<li><p>FIN: we’re done, close the connection. This is considered a normal
termination of a TCP connection.</p></li>
<li><p>NS/CWR/ECE: used to provide Explicit Congestion Notification; note
that OSI provides several methods for endpoints to know that the
network is congested.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="tcp-is-like-a-phone-call">
<h3>TCP is like a phone call<a class="headerlink" href="#tcp-is-like-a-phone-call" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>As you can see from the bytes above, TCP is all about the state of a
connection, which is basically the same as a phone call. When you pick
up the receiver, you and the caller exchange information. You say “bye”
when the call is over. If it’s a bad connection or one end suddenly gets
noisy (think jack-hammers outside), one of you can reset the connection
by saying, “Let me call you back in a minute.” Take a minute and try to
see how the other header bytes fit this analogy.</p>
<p>Also like a telephone call, TCP provides a connection (the call,
however long it lasts), flow control (provided by the two parties on
the call), multiplexing (handled by the two handsets, basically
letting through multiple frequencies and sounds, so that you can get
the tone and breath sounds of the other person, not just their raw
words).</p>
<p>Likewise, the two parties try to handle the reliability of the
connection by making sure you understand each other. The analogy
spreads a little because some of the items (connection, multiplexing)
are handled by the telephone, and some are handled by the people
operating the telephone (flow control, reliability). In the network,
the Level 4 protocol stack handles it all.</p>

<section id="there-s-a-lot-more-here">
<h3>there’s a lot more here<a class="headerlink" href="#there-s-a-lot-more-here" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There is a lot more to know about TCP, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Variable windows</p></li>
<li><p>Flow and congestion control</p></li>
<li><p>Reliability and the TCP service model - Encapsulation</p></li>
<li><p>Connection management (etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You should now have enough basic knowledge to transition to the
<cite>excellent Wikipedia article about TCP
&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&gt;</cite>. A word
of warning, though: this rabbit hole is very deep, so weigh what
you’re learning with what you actually need to know from this point
on.</p>
