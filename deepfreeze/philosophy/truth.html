<h1>truth<a class="headerlink" href="#truth" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>For much of my life, I was a casual liar.</p>
<p>As a teenager grappling with immense personal trauma—from the loss of my
sister and the breakdown of my family to the abuse by a trusted
teacher—I found myself spinning tales as a form of escape. This teacher
exploited my vulnerability, which led me down a dark path of shame and
deceit. I was afraid to be myself, and I hated myself for years –
partly for lying, and partly out of shame.</p>
<section id="breaking-free">
<h2>Breaking free<a class="headerlink" href="#breaking-free" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Shame haunted me until, years later, I found the strength to reveal the
truth. This confession didn’t immediately change my habits of
dishonesty, but it sparked a crucial transformation. Eventually, as
other victims came forward, we used the media and the legal system to
amplify our stories, which was profoundly cathartic. Within months, the
need to lie diminished; I reclaimed my voice and my truth.</p>
<p>Eventually other boys came forward, and we formed a sort of riot squad
that used the full power of the press {and the legal system} to be heard
and acknowledged. It was cathartic. I won’t say my lying vanished right
away, but it was completely gone within about eight months. Somehow,
having gotten the shame out of my system, I felt worthy to speak my
truth again.</p>

<section id="challenging-a-deceptive-culture">
<h2>Challenging a deceptive culture<a class="headerlink" href="#challenging-a-deceptive-culture" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Our society rewards deception.</p>
<p>We live in a culture that often rewards deception, whether it’s sparing
Uncle Ray’s feelings about his unloved Brussels Sprouts, or embellishing
our lives on social media to match an illusion of perfection. “Best foot
forward” is the winning move in a popularity contest, even if it means
filters, photoshop, and carefully-curated vignettes that highlight the
happy side of life.</p>
<p>I reached a breaking point and chose transparency over pretense. This
doesn’t mean I overshare, but I’ve learned to value clarity and
simplicity. When something is private, I simply say, “pass,” respecting
my boundaries without deceit. I just speak the truth, as clearly and
simply as I can express it. What you see is largely what you get.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-rewards-of-authenticity">
<h2>The rewards of authenticity<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rewards-of-authenticity" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Dropping the guise was transformative. Those who favored superficiality
drifted away, replaced by individuals who appreciate honesty. Now, I can
express my doubts, voice my opinions, and confront my past abuse without
the shadows of fear and shame. This honesty has not only mended old
wounds but also fostered genuine relationships and made daily
interactions more straightforward.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I have friends again. People listen to my opinion and act on
it. They compliment me when I do well, and feel comfortable correcting
me when I do poorly. It isn’t at all the horrible ordeal that I imagined
it would be. All of the angst I felt over my abuse had gotten conflated
with a false undercurrent of bad karma and paranoia. In short, I am now
completely open and honest with people, and nothing strange has
happened.</p>
<p>Living truthfully has simplified my life in unexpected ways. I can
decline invitations without guilt, discuss my limitations openly, and
often find that plans adapt to accommodate my honest input. The practice
of being frank has taught me to address underlying stresses and
uncomfortable truths promptly, avoiding the complexities that come with
deception.</p>
<p>In embracing total honesty, I’ve discovered a life where authenticity
leads to both personal freedom and deeper connections. It’s a journey
from darkness into a life filled with genuine interaction and peace. I
highly recommend it.</p>
