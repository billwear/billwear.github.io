<h1>Attention as Change<a class="headerlink" href="#attention-as-change" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Observing your thoughts is valuable, but how do you turn this awareness
into real change?</p>
<p>In the West, we often rush to categorize ideas and capitalize on the
promising ones, yet this approach falls short when it comes to
transforming thought patterns. Shifting these patterns requires a
gentler, less intuitive approach—one that, interestingly, aligns with a
more nuanced understanding of the brain.</p>
<section id="reinforcement-and-neural-pathways-a-digital-signal-analogy">
<h2>Reinforcement and Neural Pathways: A Digital Signal Analogy<a class="headerlink" href="#reinforcement-and-neural-pathways-a-digital-signal-analogy" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>I like to use a digital signal processor as an analogy for how the brain
operates. You take an action, it’s successful, and a neuron is
established. The next time you face a similar situation, that neuron
fires off around 40mV or more, encouraging you to repeat the behavior.</p>
<p>Occasionally, however, this habit proves ineffective, prompting the
pathway to develop an inhibitor—something that raises the threshold for
firing, reducing the likelihood of repeating the behavior. Essentially,
you learn that this technique doesn’t always apply. Yet, there are times
when, despite the inhibitor, the technique succeeds, leading to a slight
inhibition of the inhibitor itself, creating a nuanced, adaptable
response in the brain’s circuitry.</p>
<p>Over time, a complex network of amplifiers and inhibitors forms around
this behavior, reinforcing it into a strong habit. The longer this web
of neural connections proves successful, the more resilient—and
resistant to change—it becomes. In essence, “old habits die hard.”</p>

<h2>Breaking the Habit Loop: The Power of Honest Emotion<a class="headerlink" href="#breaking-the-habit-loop-the-power-of-honest-emotion" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, habits aren’t as immovable as they seem. I
discovered an approach that can shift even the most entrenched habits
relatively quickly: by observing your thoughts and applying genuine
feelings of “like” or “dislike” to what you uncover.</p>
<p>For a long time, I harbored unchecked “hero complex” thoughts. Whenever
someone acted in a way I disliked or circumstances placed me somewhere I
didn’t want to be, I’d respond by imagining myself in a heroic scenario
that vindicated my position and proved others wrong. Looking back, I see
this mindset was loaded with flawed assumptions about people,
situations, and even my own role within them.</p>
<p>One day, I recognized just how often I fell into this pattern. Almost
instinctively, I paused and thought, “I really don’t like <em>thinking</em>
this way.” Within a few days, I noticed the habit beginning to fade. It
took some time to understand why, but gradually I realized that this
specific distaste for the thought process itself had a unique impact,
unlike broader, more generalized statements.</p>
<p>Today, I’ve come to see that a wide range of thought patterns can be
quickly softened or strengthened simply by saying, with genuine feeling,
“I don’t like thinking this way” or “I like having thoughts like this.”
This isn’t a scientific conclusion from a neuroscientist—just an
observation from an armchair philosopher.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-this-insight-to-change">
<h2>Using This Insight to Change<a class="headerlink" href="#using-this-insight-to-change" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Recognizing the influence of our own emotional responses to thought
patterns opens up a powerful way to alter them. By simply acknowledging
whether we genuinely <em>like</em> or <em>dislike</em> a particular thought, we can
start to steer our mind toward healthier, more constructive habits. This
isn’t about forcing ourselves to feel differently; rather, it’s about
observing our natural preferences and using them to reshape our
thinking. The beauty of this approach is that it relies on
honesty—authentically responding to our thoughts rather than trying to
impose judgment on them.</p>
<p>Once you notice a recurring thought you’d rather avoid, try expressing
your genuine feelings about it. Saying, “I don’t like thinking this way”
signals to your brain that this pattern isn’t desirable, and over time,
the intensity of the thought can start to fade. This technique is
especially helpful with intrusive or self-critical thoughts, which often
become less frequent when we openly acknowledge that they don’t serve us
well. Gradually, it becomes easier to let these thoughts go, as they
lose their hold over your mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, reinforcing positive thoughts by saying, “I like thinking
this way,” strengthens the neural pathways that support them. For
example, if you find yourself reflecting on a satisfying accomplishment
or feeling gratitude, acknowledge your enjoyment of those thoughts. This
not only makes these thought patterns more resilient but also encourages
your mind to seek them out more naturally. In essence, you’re teaching
your brain to favor patterns that support your well-being.</p>
<p>This approach doesn’t require deep introspection or lengthy analysis; it
works simply by observing your thoughts and honestly responding to them.
It’s a subtle but effective way to create mental habits that align with
your values and goals. Over time, the brain adapts, amplifying thoughts
you affirm and weakening those you reject. This method allows for
gradual change without the strain of forcibly trying to control or alter
your mindset.</p>
<p>As with any new practice, consistency is key. The more often you
acknowledge your honest feelings about your thoughts, the faster you’ll
notice a shift. Thought patterns that once felt rigid or unyielding can
soften, opening space for healthier habits to take root. In this way,
simply embracing or releasing thoughts with authentic emotion can be a
gentle yet powerful catalyst for meaningful, lasting change.</p>
