How to use logging

    Errors or typos? Topics missing? Hard to read? Let us know.

MAAS logging and auditing capabilities are powerful assets for administrators, developers, and auditors alike. The platform provides comprehensive logging facilities that span various functional aspects, from events and auditing to hardware commissioning and testing. MAAS logs serve as invaluable diagnostic and monitoring tools for your provisioning environment:

    Event logs: The cornerstone for debugging, event logs offer deep insights that can help you troubleshoot a wide array of MAAS-related challenges.

    Audit event logs: For governance and accountability, audit event logs keep a meticulous record of who did what within the MAAS ecosystem, aiding in traceability and compliance.

    Commissioning logs: When commissioning a machine, these logs become your go-to source for understanding each action, test, and result that occurred during the process, offering a granular look into your infrastructure.

    Testing logs: These logs specialise in hardware diagnostics, providing detailed reports that help you identify and rectify hardware anomalies and issues.

Each log type serves a unique purpose and, when used collectively, they make it easier to manage your MAAS instance.

    
How to use MAAS systemd logs

    MAAS 3.5 log commands
    Pre-3.5 log commands

MAAS logs considerable runtime information to standard log files, useful when things don’t work as expected. Prior to version 3.5, MAAS used custom log files for different components of the MAAS architecture. In version 3.5, all logging has been transferred to the standard systemd logs. This page gives a summary of how to access runtime logging for both version groups.

Reviewing logs

Take a look at what a simple view of your event logs might resemble:

  Time 	                      Event
  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:12:35 	Ready
  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:12:31 	Running test - smartctl-validate on sda

  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:09:54 	Powering on
  Sun, 04 Oct. 2020 23:09:53 	Commissioning

Navigating

    In the UI: Navigate to a specific machine from the machine list and click on the “Events” tab at the top. For a more detailed history, select “View full history” near the upper right of the log display.

    In the CLI: Access raw events with:

    maas $PROFILE events query

To arrange the results neatly, try:

    maas admin events query | jq -r '(["HOSTNAME","TIMESTAMP","TYPE","DESCRIPTION"] | (., map(length*"-"))), (.events[] | [.hostname, .created, .type, .description // "-"]) | @tsv' | column -t -s $'\t'

Categorising events

MAAS events generally fall into four intriguing categories:

    INFO: Just the facts, like news updates for your machines.
    WARNING: Yellow flags on the racetrack, cautioning you to investigate.
    ERROR: Red flags telling you that something has broken down.
    DEBUG: Behind-the-scenes footage for those who love details.

Each category has internal and external representations, useful for those times when MAAS decides to throw cryptic exceptions your way.

Commissioning logs provide insights into the commissioning process, detailing script executions with timestamps and outcomes. This page explains how to access these logs.
Introduction to commissioning logs

Commissioning logs document the execution of commissioning scripts, each entry detailing the script name, execution timestamp, and result (e.g., passed, failed). These logs are crucial for troubleshooting and ensuring the successful commissioning of machines within MAAS.
Viewing commissioning logs in the UI

To explore detailed logs for each script, navigate to the “Commissioning” tab of a specific machine. A status table presents all commissioning scripts, their outcomes, and links to detailed logs. Examining these logs offers insights into each script’s function and output.
Retrieving commissioning logs via MAAS CLI

For a direct approach, use the MAAS CLI to fetch verbatim logs of commissioning script executions. This method is ideal for accessing logs of current or past script runs:

maas $PROFILE node-script-result read $SYSTEM_ID $RESULTS

To focus on specific results, such as the latest or currently-running scripts, replace $SYSTEM_ID with current-commissioning, current-testing, or current-installation. Further refine the results by script type, name, or run:

maas $PROFILE node-script-results read \
 $SYSTEM_ID type=$SCRIPT_TYPE filters=$SCRIPT_NAME,$TAGS

Suppressing failed results

To exclude known failures from your analysis, suppress failed results:

maas $PROFILE node-script-results update \
 $SYSTEM_ID type=$SCRIPT_TYPE filters=$SCRIPT_NAME,$TAGS suppressed=$SUPPRESSED

Setting $SUPPRESSED to True or False will adjust the visibility of these results in the output.
Downloading commissioning script results

Download script results for offline analysis or documentation purposes:

maas $PROFILE node-script-result download $SYSTEM_ID $RUN_ID output=all \
 filetype=tar.xz > $LOCAL_FILENAME

Use $RUN_ID, identified as id in detailed output, to specify the desired script run for download.

    Errors or typos? Topics missing? Hard to read? Let us know.

This page provides concise procedures for working with MAAS audit events.
List audit events

To get a list of MAAS audit events, you can use the following MAAS CLI command:

$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT

This command will list all audit events. The output will include details such as username, hostname, date, and event description.
Filter events by hostname

To filter audit events by a specific hostname, use the following MAAS CLI command:

$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT hostname=your-hostname

Replace your-hostname with the desired hostname. This command will list audit events specific to the provided hostname.
Filter events by MAC

If you want to filter audit events by a specific MAC address, use this MAAS CLI command:

$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT mac_address=00:11:22:33:44:55

Replace 00:11:22:33:44:55 with the MAC address you want to filter by. This command will display audit events related to the specified MAC address.
Filter events by SYSID

To filter audit events by a specific system ID, use the following MAAS CLI command:

$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT id=system-id

Replace system-id with the desired system ID. This command will list audit events specific to the provided system ID.
Filter events by zone

If you want to filter audit events by a specific zone, use the following MAAS CLI command:

$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT zone=your-zone

Replace your-zone with the desired zone name. This command will display audit events for machines in the specified zone.
Filter events by owner

To filter audit events by the owner of the machine, use this MAAS CLI command:

$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT owner=owner-username

Replace owner-username with the username of the machine’s owner. This command will list audit events for machines owned by the specified user.
Limit event count

You can limit the number of audit events displayed using the limit parameter. For example:

$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT limit=10

This command will limit the output to the last 10 audit events. You can adjust the limit to your preference.
Move event window

To display audit events occurring after a specific event ID, you can use the after parameter. For example:

$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT after=event-id

Replace event-id with the ID of the event you want to start from. This command will display audit events that occurred after the specified event.
Audit life-cycles

To audit a machine’s life cycle, you can collect audit data for a specific machine over time. First, collect a significant amount of audit data for the machine using the hostname filter:

$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT hostname=your-hostname limit=1000 > /tmp/audit-data

This command will retrieve a substantial number of audit events for the specified hostname and store them in a file named audit-data.

Next, you can analyse this data to track changes, actions, and events related to the machine’s life cycle. This can help in troubleshooting and monitoring machine behaviour over time.

How to review audit logs

    Auditing MAAS

    Errors or typos? Topics missing? Hard to read? Let us know.

Audit events are a subset of the MAAS event logs. This page provides reference material for those who want to review and report on events designated as MAAS audit events.
Auditing MAAS

MAAS audit events can be viewed using the CLI with a command similar to the following:

maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT

Such a command would produce JSON output like this:

These MAAS audit events consist of the following information:

    username: the name of the user whose actions triggered the event. This field is frequently blank, since many recordable events are triggered by MAAS and not by a specific user.
    node: this is the $SYSTEM_ID frequently used in the CLI to reference node. This field is filled if a particular node participated in the event, even if the node did not trigger that event.
    hostname: this is the node which triggered the event. Generally, this will be the name of the region controller, the name of a machine, or blank. Blank entries are events triggered by MAAS itself, such as Starting rack boot image import, which are not triggered by node.
    id: a unique ID number assigned to table records as a primary key.
    level: the level of event, such as AUDIT, DEBUG, etc.
    created: the timestamp when this event entry was created.
    description: a long text description of what took place. This field is almost always populated; this is the primary information used for auditing MAAS events.
    type: this is the type of event that occurred, as shown in the following table.

name 	description
AUTHORISATION 	Authorisation
