powering through
================

Today is one of those days. I'm traveling, currently in the Hague for
work meetings. It's Thursday, and going-home day is Saturday., My
sinuses started rebelling a little this morning, and i started
convincing myself that I was having that "hit-by-a-truck" feeling you
sometimes get. Only two days till I go home, and then two days later I
meet with the sinus doctor at 9am to talk about surgery, so I think I
can limp along till then.

It's just the limping part. I have some Aleve 275 and some Deflatine
(for the inevitable stomach issues associated with drainage). That will
have to be good enough. But I don't like limping. So now what?

The idea of "powering through"
------------------------------

I've heard this my whole life: "just power through it." Never been that
easy for me; I usually end up collapsing into my bed at some point
during the day, as if napping would help -- mainly, because it does.
Sleep has some value for those who don't feel particularly well,
probably because you're not particularly focused on how bad you feel. In
a sense, you're not mentally interfering with what your body is trying
to do to heal you, I guess.

I dunno, but it is an interesting thing to think about. As soon as I
feel better.
