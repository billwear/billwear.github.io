<h1>my credo</h1>
<ol>
<li><b>Say what you mean</b>; because telepathy is still in beta testing.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Be choosy with your media</b>, because your brain thinks it's real. Unless, of course, you're watching someone paint happy little trees.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Speak clearly, listen carefully, pay close attention</b>; otherwise, you'll end up in a conversation about quantum physics when you just asked for the time.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Do what you love</b>; life's too short not to ply your craft</b>. Just don't expect it to pay the bills, unless your craft is printing money.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Keep it simple</b>; complex plans involve running, and who's got the energy for that?</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Start small and build a little at a time</b>; a mosaic is more beautiful than the finest concrete, and way less likely to get you sued for improper construction.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Network</b>; because who else will laugh at your "I'm not a robot" jokes?</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Be who you are</b>; even a bent wire can carry a great light, especially in a modern art exhibit.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Build for strength, not just speed</b>; the hare may have had more Instagram followers, but the tortoise won the race.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Hack</b>; just remember, "try it and see" doesn't apply to skydiving or lion taming.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Under-promise and over-deliver</b>; because everyone loves a surprise, especially when it's not another birthday card.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Divide and conquer</b>; because life is essentially a giant game of strategy board games.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Do one thing well</b>; remember, unicorns are famous for just one horn.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Use what you have</b>; unless it's a floppy disk, then maybe it's time to upgrade.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Use levers, not people</b>; because people are terrible at being levers, they keep asking for coffee breaks.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Release early, release often</b>; otherwise, you're just hoarding half-baked ideas, and there's no market for those.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Distrust all claims for the one true way</b>; except for pizza, pizza is always the answer.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Think ahead, but don’t worship your plans</b>; all things are possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Think big: you are the universe</b>. And like any good universe, remember to occasionally expand beyond your current dimensions — just without the big bang.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Abhor violence in all its forms</b>, even contradicting others. Keep your peace, hold your tongue, and avoid turning into a debate club mascot.</li>
<br/>
<li><b>Practice the Prime Directive</b>; unless you're in a sci-fi movie, then totally ignore it.</li>
<br/>
</ul>
