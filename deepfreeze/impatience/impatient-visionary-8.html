<h2><strong>The Science of Multitasking: Why Your Brain Prefers Focus</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-science-of-multitasking-why-your-brain-prefers-focus" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Let’s start by addressing the myth of multitasking. While it might seem
like you can tackle multiple projects at once, your brain isn’t designed
to handle several complex tasks simultaneously. In fact,
<strong>multitasking</strong> is a bit of a misnomer—it’s really just rapid
<strong>task-switching</strong>, which increases cognitive load and makes it harder
to focus.</p>
<section id="the-cost-of-task-switching">
<h3><strong>1. The Cost of Task-Switching</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-cost-of-task-switching" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Each time you switch from one task to another, your brain experiences a
<strong>lag</strong> as it reorients itself. This transition time might seem small,
but it adds up quickly, leading to decision fatigue and a loss of focus.
The more often you switch between projects or tasks, the more mental
energy you burn just trying to keep up.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-power-of-serial-focus">
<h3><strong>2. The Power of Serial Focus</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-power-of-serial-focus" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The antidote to the cost of multitasking is what researchers call
<strong>serial focus</strong>—working on one task or project at a time before moving
on to the next. By focusing on one thing at a time, you reduce the
cognitive load associated with task-switching and allow your brain to
dive deeper into each project.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll explore how to structure your Org-mode workflow
to support serial focus while still keeping multiple projects on track.</p>

<section id="step-1-organizing-multiple-projects-in-org-mode">
<h2><strong>Step 1: Organizing Multiple Projects in Org-mode</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-organizing-multiple-projects-in-org-mode" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The first step to balancing multiple projects is creating a system that
keeps everything organized and visible without overwhelming you.
Org-mode’s hierarchical structure and agenda views are perfect for this.</p>
<section id="creating-separate-project-sections">
<h3><strong>1. Creating Separate Project Sections</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#creating-separate-project-sections" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In Org-mode, each project should have its own section. This keeps your
projects neatly separated, while still allowing you to track them all in
one place. Let’s say you have three big projects you’re managing
simultaneously: building an open-source product, writing a book, and
renovating a house. Your Org file might look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-org notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* Build an Open-Source Product
** Phase 1: Research and Planning
** Phase 2: Development
** Phase 3: Beta Testing
** Phase 4: Launch

* Write a Book
** Phase 1: Outline
** Phase 2: First Draft
** Phase 3: Editing
** Phase 4: Publishing

* Renovate House
** Phase 1: Kitchen Remodel
** Phase 2: Bathroom Renovation
** Phase 3: Electrical Work
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each project has its own space, with its respective phases and tasks.
This keeps things clean and allows you to focus on one project at a time
without losing sight of the others.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-tags-to-group-similar-tasks-across-projects">
<h3><strong>2. Using Tags to Group Similar Tasks Across Projects</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#using-tags-to-group-similar-tasks-across-projects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>While you may be working on different projects, there are often similar
types of tasks across them—like research, writing, or managing
deadlines. You can use Org-mode <strong>tags</strong> to group these tasks and make
it easier to batch them when necessary.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-org notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* Build an Open-Source Product
** Phase 1: Research and Planning :research:
** Phase 2: Development :coding:

* Write a Book
** Phase 1: Outline :writing:
** Phase 2: First Draft :writing:

* Renovate House
** Phase 1: Kitchen Remodel :planning:
** Phase 2: Electrical Work :planning:
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using tags like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:research:</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:writing:</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:planning:</span></code>, you
can quickly filter and view all tasks of a certain type across multiple
projects. This allows you to work in <strong>focus blocks</strong>, where you can
dedicate time to a specific type of work across different projects,
rather than jumping between unrelated tasks.</p>
</section>
</section>
<hr class="docutils" />
<section id="step-2-prioritizing-multiple-projects">
<h2><strong>Step 2: Prioritizing Multiple Projects</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-prioritizing-multiple-projects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When managing multiple projects, <strong>prioritization</strong> is key. Not all
projects will have the same urgency or importance at any given time.
Org-mode allows you to assign priorities to tasks and projects, ensuring
that you stay focused on what matters most without losing sight of
lower-priority work.</p>
<section id="setting-priorities-in-org-mode">
<h3><strong>1. Setting Priorities in Org-mode</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#setting-priorities-in-org-mode" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Org-mode has built-in support for task priorities. You can set a
priority for any task using a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[#]</span></code> notation:</p>
<div class="highlight-org notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* Build an Open-Source Product
** Phase 1: Research and Planning [#A]  ;; Highest priority
*** TODO Identify target audience [#A]
*** TODO Draft project roadmap [#B]

* Write a Book
** Phase 1: Outline [#B]  ;; Medium priority
*** TODO Write chapter summaries [#B]

* Renovate House
** Phase 1: Kitchen Remodel [#C]  ;; Lower priority
*** TODO Finalize kitchen design [#C]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[A]</span></code> is the highest priority, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[B]</span></code> is medium priority, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[C]</span></code> is low priority. By assigning priorities, you ensure that you’re
always working on the most important tasks first, even across multiple
projects.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-the-org-agenda-for-prioritization">
<h3><strong>2. Using the Org Agenda for Prioritization</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-org-agenda-for-prioritization" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Org Agenda</strong> is your best friend when it comes to managing
priorities across multiple projects. Once you’ve set up priorities for
your tasks, you can view them in the agenda and sort by priority. This
helps you stay focused on what’s most important across all your
projects.</p>
<p>To open the agenda, press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">c</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code>, and you’ll see a list of your
tasks organized by priority and deadline. This gives you a clear,
at-a-glance view of what needs your attention today and what can wait.</p>
</section>

<hr class="docutils" />
<section id="step-3-time-blocking-for-multiple-projects">
<h2><strong>Step 3: Time Blocking for Multiple Projects</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-time-blocking-for-multiple-projects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>One of the most effective ways to balance multiple projects is by using
<strong>time blocking</strong>. This means dedicating specific blocks of time to each
project, rather than trying to work on all of them in parallel
throughout the day. Time blocking helps you focus deeply on one project
at a time, reducing the cognitive load of task-switching.</p>
<section id="scheduling-focus-blocks-in-org-mode">
<h3><strong>1. Scheduling Focus Blocks in Org-mode</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#scheduling-focus-blocks-in-org-mode" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>You can use Org-mode’s <strong>schedule</strong> feature to block out time for
specific projects in your day. For example, you might block out the
morning for writing and the afternoon for coding. Here’s how to schedule
focus blocks:</p>
<div class="highlight-org notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* Focus Blocks for Monday, September 25
** TODO Write for 2 hours (Book Project)
   SCHEDULED: &lt;2024-09-25 08:00-10:00&gt;
** TODO Code for 2 hours (Open-Source Project)
   SCHEDULED: &lt;2024-09-25 11:00-13:00&gt;
** TODO Research kitchen designs (Renovation)
   SCHEDULED: &lt;2024-09-25 14:00-16:00&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>By blocking out specific times for each project, you can give your full
attention to one project at a time, without feeling like you need to
juggle everything simultaneously. This reduces stress and allows for
deeper work.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-pomodoro-technique-for-deep-focus">
<h3><strong>2. Using Pomodoro Technique for Deep Focus</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#using-pomodoro-technique-for-deep-focus" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> is a time management method that involves
working in short, focused bursts (typically 25 minutes) followed by
short breaks. This technique is perfect for balancing multiple projects,
as it allows you to stay focused on one task while giving your brain
regular rest intervals.</p>
<p>In Org-mode, you can track Pomodoro sessions by adding custom timers.
Here’s an example of how you might structure a Pomodoro session for your
writing focus block:</p>
<div class="highlight-org notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* TODO Write for 2 hours (Book Project)
   SCHEDULED: &lt;2024-09-25 08:00-10:00&gt;
   :LOGBOOK:
   - Start: [2024-09-25 08:00] Pomodoro 1
   - Break: [2024-09-25 08:25] Pomodoro 1 break
   - Start: [2024-09-25 08:30] Pomodoro 2
   :END:
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>By using Pomodoro timers, you can maintain deep focus while still giving
yourself regular breaks to recharge. This technique is especially
helpful when switching between different types of work.</p>

<section id="step-4-reviewing-progress-across-projects">
<h2><strong>Step 4: Reviewing Progress Across Projects</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-4-reviewing-progress-across-projects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>To keep multiple projects on track, it’s important to regularly
<strong>review</strong> your progress. This allows you to assess where you are,
adjust priorities, and make sure you’re moving forward on all fronts.</p>
<section id="scheduling-weekly-and-monthly-reviews">
<h3><strong>1. Scheduling Weekly and Monthly Reviews</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#scheduling-weekly-and-monthly-reviews" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In Org-mode, you can schedule regular <strong>weekly</strong> and <strong>monthly</strong> reviews
to check in on your progress across all projects. These reviews give you
a chance to reassess your priorities, identify any roadblocks, and
adjust your timeline as needed.</p>
<p>Here’s how you might set up a weekly review in Org-mode:</p>
<div class="highlight-org notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* TODO Weekly Project Review
   SCHEDULED: &lt;2024-09-29 +1w&gt;
   - [ ] Review progress on open-source project
   - [ ] Review writing progress
   - [ ] Review renovation milestones
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>During your weekly review, you can ask yourself: - What did I achieve
this week across all projects? - Where did I make the most progress? -
What needs more attention next week?</p>
<p>For long-term projects, schedule <strong>monthly</strong></p>
<p>reviews to assess overall progress, adjust timelines, and ensure that
you’re still on track to meet your larger goals.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflecting-on-whats-working-and-whats-not">
<h3><strong>2. Reflecting on What’s Working and What’s Not</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#reflecting-on-whats-working-and-whats-not" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>In your reviews, it’s important to take time to reflect on what’s
working and where you’re getting stuck. Some projects may be moving
faster than others, and that’s okay. The key is to <strong>adjust</strong> without
feeling overwhelmed by what isn’t done yet.</p>
<p>Use Org-mode to add reflection notes during your reviews:</p>
<div class="highlight-org notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* TODO Weekly Project Review
   SCHEDULED: &lt;2024-09-29 +1w&gt;
   :LOGBOOK:
   - Reflection: Good progress on writing, but need more time for development work.
   :END:
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This reflection helps you stay adaptive and prevents frustration from
piling up when things don’t go as planned.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion: The Art of Juggling Projects with Focus</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion-the-art-of-juggling-projects-with-focus" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Balancing multiple long-term projects is an art. It requires focus,
prioritization, and regular review to ensure that nothing slips through
the cracks. By using Org-mode to separate your projects, assign
priorities, schedule time blocks, and conduct regular reviews, you
create a system that allows you to make steady progress without feeling
overwhelmed.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ve explored how to manage competing priorities while
keeping your visionary mind engaged. The key is to avoid task-switching
as much as possible by focusing on one project at a time and giving each
project the time and attention it deserves.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll explore how to stay motivated over the long
haul, especially when projects hit rough patches or when you’re feeling
burned out. But for now, take a moment to review your current projects
and make sure that you have a clear plan for balancing them.</p>
<p>Let’s keep moving forward.</p>
