<h1>Fear of Flying<a class="headerlink" href="#fear-of-flying" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>You’ve got the vision, and you’ve read about the gap between ideas and
reality. Now it’s time to tackle something that isn’t often spoken
about: the <strong>fear of flying</strong>. Not the literal kind, but the kind that
holds you back from the grind—the fear of starting something unfamiliar,
the discomfort of doing work that doesn’t spark the same excitement as
the vision itself.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this, you’ve likely experienced it before: the
resistance to learning something new, the hesitation to dive into the
“hard” stuff. It’s easy to be drawn to the shiny world of new ideas, but
when it comes time to put in the work, there’s this wall you hit—an
internal resistance that whispers, <em>maybe later</em>.</p>
<p>And that’s where we’re going to start, head-on. This chapter is about
addressing that fear and confronting it through the lens of <strong>brain
science</strong>. You’re going to take that fear of the unfamiliar, the fear of
“doing,” and turn it into fuel for realizing your vision.</p>
<p>We’re going to use tools that will seem intimidating at first: <strong>Emacs
and Org-mode</strong>. But here’s the thing—you’re going to learn just enough
to get moving, just enough to make the process of turning ideas into
action a little more structured, a little more manageable. And more
importantly, you’re going to learn <em>why</em> your brain resists this, and
<em>how</em> to work with it rather than against it.</p>
<section id="fear-and-unfamiliarity">
<h2><strong>Fear and Unfamiliarity</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#fear-and-unfamiliarity" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Let’s start with a deep dive into the <strong>science of fear</strong> and how your
brain reacts to unfamiliar tasks. The brain isn’t just a machine, it’s a
highly sensitive, highly adaptable organ that craves comfort and
familiarity. When you encounter something new, like learning a tool
you’ve never used before (say, Emacs), your brain throws up a red flag.
It detects <strong>uncertainty</strong>, and it wants to retreat.</p>
<section id="the-role-of-the-amygdala">
<h3>1. <strong>The Role of the Amygdala</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-the-amygdala" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The part of your brain responsible for this fear response is the
<strong>amygdala</strong>. It’s an ancient structure, deeply embedded in your limbic
system, and its job is to keep you safe. When faced with an unfamiliar
challenge, like a complex software tool, the amygdala sends out signals
that trigger anxiety or hesitation. It’s saying, <em>Wait, this feels
risky. We don’t know how this works yet. Let’s avoid it</em>.</p>
<p>That’s why when you sit down to learn something like Emacs, it feels
like you’re wading through mental quicksand. Your brain is wired to
protect you from the discomfort of uncertainty by making you avoid the
task altogether.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-prefrontal-cortex-vs-the-amygdala">
<h3>2. <strong>The Prefrontal Cortex vs. the Amygdala</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-prefrontal-cortex-vs-the-amygdala" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>However, there’s another part of your brain—the <strong>prefrontal
cortex</strong>—that is responsible for logical thinking, problem-solving, and
planning. It’s the rational, forward-looking part of you that knows
Emacs is just a tool. It understands that once you get past the initial
learning curve, this tool will help you organize your ideas and execute
on them. But here’s the rub: the prefrontal cortex requires energy and
effort to override the emotional fear response from the amygdala.</p>
<p>The amygdala says, <em>Stay safe.</em> The prefrontal cortex says, <em>Push
through the discomfort; there’s something useful on the other side</em>.
These two systems are constantly at odds when you’re facing something
unfamiliar. The trick is learning how to <strong>train</strong> your prefrontal
cortex to calm the amygdala, so you can stay in the zone long enough to
push through and learn.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-power-of-dopamine-and-novelty">
<h3>3. <strong>The Power of Dopamine and Novelty</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-power-of-dopamine-and-novelty" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Another critical player is <strong>dopamine</strong>, the neurotransmitter
responsible for motivation and pleasure. Here’s why this matters:
Dopamine is released when you’re working on something novel, something
exciting—like dreaming up new ideas. But when you shift from the
brainstorming phase to the realization phase, where the work gets
repetitive and unfamiliar, dopamine levels drop. That drop is why you
feel like the grind isn’t worth it—it’s not giving your brain the
pleasure it craves.</p>
<p>Your brain doesn’t want to focus on mundane tasks like learning how to
navigate a new system. It would rather jump to the next shiny idea,
where the dopamine flow is stronger. But here’s where things get
interesting: once you start making progress with a new tool, your brain
will <em>reward</em> you with dopamine. Progress—no matter how small—stimulates
the reward pathways in your brain. This is why taking small, achievable
steps is key to working <em>with</em> your brain’s chemistry.</p>

<h2><strong>Emacs and Org-mode: The Tools of Choice</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#emacs-and-org-mode-the-tools-of-choice" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You’ve probably heard of <strong>Emacs</strong> and its powerful mode for organizing
thoughts: <strong>Org-mode</strong>. At first glance, Emacs looks complicated—there
are commands, keybindings, and a text-based interface that feels like a
relic of the past. Your brain will probably go into fight-or-flight mode
the first time you open it. That’s normal.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: Emacs and Org-mode aren’t just tools. They are
<strong>systems</strong> that can help you manage the chaos of big ideas. Think of
them as an extension of your brain—a structure to organize your vision,
track progress, and keep you accountable without drowning you in
details. Emacs isn’t just another app—it’s a framework for turning
visionary thinking into actionable steps. And once you learn just enough
to get comfortable, your prefrontal cortex will settle into a rhythm.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-1-overcoming-the-brains-fear-of-unfamiliarity">
<h2><strong>Step 1: Overcoming the Brain’s Fear of Unfamiliarity</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-overcoming-the-brains-fear-of-unfamiliarity" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Before we jump into the mechanics of Emacs, let’s acknowledge the
brain’s initial reaction: <strong>this is hard</strong>. That fear is real, but we’re
going to break it down in a way that works with your brain, not against
it.</p>
<p>Here’s the plan: instead of throwing yourself into the deep end, we’ll
start with the basics—just enough to get moving. This is important
because when you take small, digestible steps, your brain’s fear
response (triggered by the amygdala) is reduced. Meanwhile, the
prefrontal cortex can build confidence as you experience small wins,
which, in turn, releases dopamine to keep you motivated.</p>

<section id="step-2-getting-around-in-emacs-and-why-it-wont-kill-you">
<h2><strong>Step 2: Getting Around in Emacs (and Why It Won’t Kill You)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-getting-around-in-emacs-and-why-it-wont-kill-you" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Let’s demystify Emacs. You don’t need to learn everything at once. In
fact, learning Emacs is like learning to ride a bike—awkward at first,
but soon you’ll stop thinking about the mechanics and start focusing on
the ride. Remember, your brain is scared because it’s unfamiliar, not
because it’s impossible.</p>
<p>Here’s how we’ll start:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Install Emacs</strong>: If you haven’t already, get Emacs up and running
on your system. The first interaction with Emacs is the hardest,
simply because it’s new. Whether you’re on Linux, macOS, or Windows,
there’s a straightforward installation path. Your brain’s amygdala
will try to resist by making excuses, but your prefrontal cortex will
step in and remind you that this is the first, small step.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Basic Navigation</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Move the cursor using the arrow keys. Don’t worry about learning
fancy commands yet—just focus on moving around. Your brain is
already learning the new terrain.</p></li>
<li><p>Open a file: Press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">x</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">f</span></code>. Your brain now
knows that there’s a way to open files, and this simple action has
reduced some of the uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p>Save a file: Press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">x</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">s</span></code>. This familiar
“save” function gives you a sense of control, which reduces fear.
You’ve already achieved a micro-win.</p></li>
<li><p>Quit Emacs: Press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">x</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">c</span></code>. You’ve entered,
saved, and exited Emacs. These small actions are reprogramming
your brain to see Emacs as something manageable.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Practice, Don’t Perfect</strong>: Don’t get caught up in mastering
everything. Let your brain adapt to the feeling of being a beginner
again. Your prefrontal cortex thrives on repeated exposure to the
unfamiliar—it’s how you learn new skills. The more you interact with
Emacs, the more natural it will feel. Remember: small wins build
momentum.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="step-3-introducing-org-mode-your-brains-new-assistant">
<h2><strong>Step 3: Introducing Org-mode (Your Brain’s New Assistant)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-introducing-org-mode-your-brains-new-assistant" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Now that you’ve touched the surface of Emacs, it’s time to meet
Org-mode. Think of Org-mode as a cognitive extension—it’s a system
designed to help you organize your thoughts, projects, and tasks in a
way that aligns with how your brain works.</p>
<p>Org-mode lets you create structure without limiting your creativity.
Here’s how we’ll start:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Create Your First Org File</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Open Emacs and press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">x</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">f</span></code> to create a
new file. Name it something simple like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">projects.org</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The unfamiliarity will trigger some resistance, but stay with it.
Your prefrontal cortex is adapting.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Headings and Subheadings</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">Big</span> <span class="pre">Idea</span></code> and hit Enter. This is your main heading. By
creating structure, your brain feels in control, which helps
reduce the anxiety caused by unfamiliarity.</p></li>
<li><p>Add subheadings by typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span> <span class="pre">First</span> <span class="pre">Task</span></code> and hitting Enter.
You’re breaking down big ideas into smaller, manageable chunks,
which not only helps with realization but also soothes your
brain’s natural aversion to complexity.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Todo Items</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Turn a heading into a task by pressing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">c</span></code>, then
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">t</span></code>. This creates a TODO item. This simple structure
brings clarity and organization, giving your brain the dopamine
hit it craves.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Capture Ideas</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Org-mode lets you quickly capture ideas without interrupting your
flow. Press <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">c</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">c</span></code> to add a new item. The
key here is to capture thoughts as they come, without
overthinking. This keeps your brain clear while giving you the
satisfaction of having recorded your ideas in an organized way.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Step 4: Overcoming the Brain’s Resistance to Doing</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#step-4-overcoming-the-brains-resistance-to-doing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Now that you’ve made it this far, here’s the hard truth: Your brain will
still try to resist. This isn’t about Emacs being difficult—it’s about
your brain’s discomfort with the work of <em>doing</em>. The unfamiliar is
hard, not because it’s truly difficult, but because your brain is wired
to avoid the discomfort of learning.</p>
<p>But here’s where science can help. Every time you push through that
resistance, you are training your brain. The more you expose yourself to
the newness of Emacs and Org-mode, the more your brain will accept it as
familiar. That familiarity will lower the fear response from your
amygdala and make way for the prefrontal cortex to take control.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrate the wins</strong>: Every time you save a file, every time you
create a new Org-mode heading, you’re training your brain to see
progress. That sense of progress, no matter how small, is what keeps
dopamine flowing.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion: Facing the Fear and Moving Forward</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion-facing-the-fear-and-moving-forward" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You’ve taken the first step. Your brain has been challenged by something
new, but it’s already adapting. You’ve learned the basics of Emacs,
started with Org-mode, and confronted the fear of unfamiliarity head-on.
The fear isn’t gone, but now you understand it. More importantly, you
understand how to work through it.</p>
<p>The next steps are about continuing to build this relationship with your
tools. Emacs and Org-mode aren’t just software—they’re the systems that
will help you turn your ideas into reality. And the more familiar they
become, the less resistance your brain will throw at you.</p>
<p>You’re starting to <strong>fly</strong>. Let’s keep pushing through.</p>
