        <h2>Strengths</h2>

        <h3>✅ Insightful understanding</h3>
        <p>I pick up on emotional nuance quickly and use it to build real connections. If empathy were a sport, I’d medal — and the referee might cry during the anthem.</p>

        <h3>✅ Gentle persuasion</h3>
        <p>Clear, empathetic language helps me guide groups toward consensus. I don’t twist arms; I offer cookies until we agree.</p>

        <h3>✅ Independent thinking</h3>
        <p>Give me autonomy and I’ll explore, prototype, and circle back with something useful — or at least surprisingly elegant.</p>

        <h3>✅ Quiet determination</h3>
        <p>I prefer steady progress to public drama. Less confetti, more completion.</p>

        <h3>✅ Reflective approach</h3>
        <p>Slowing down to think usually saves time. My drafts do push-ups before they ship.</p>

        <h3>✅ Authentic presence</h3>
        <p>Honesty and a sense of humor go a long way. What you see is what you get — minus the parts that haven’t had coffee yet.</p>

        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>

        <h3>⚠️ Idealism vs. pragmatism</h3>
        <p>I aim high and sometimes forget the ladder. I’m learning to pack both.</p>

        <h3>⚠️ Networking drains me</h3>
        <p>Self-promotion and speed-meeting can feel like extrovert Olympics. I bring snacks and follow-through.</p>

        <h3>⚠️ Organization (on a timer)</h3>
        <p>I run in seasons: precision mode and deep-focus mode. Routine works — for about three days before my brain files a protest.</p>

        <h3>⚠️ Reluctant to advocate</h3>
        <p>My trumpet has a permanent mute. I’m practicing un-muting when the moment calls for it.</p>

        <h3>ℹ️ Feedback doesn’t scare me</h3>
        <p>I feel the sting, then listen for the signal. If there’s a grain of truth, I want it. I’ll dodge only the unhelpful bullets.</p>
