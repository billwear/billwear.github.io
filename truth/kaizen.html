<h1>Kaizen, or the Mustard Seed<a class="headerlink" href="#kaizen-or-the-mustard-seed" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>When you believe (as I do) that your actions define your personal
meaning, inaction is anathema. When it comes to large tasks, goals,
dreams even, I have a “point of infinite procrastination,” which to me
represents ultimate meaninglessness. In some ways, this is the point at
which my philosphy inverts itself: Nothing I’m doing at the moment has
any particular meaning, so why should I bother to act? It’s a mood, at
best.</p>
<p>The more tired I am, the easier it is to become meaningless. At 11pm, my
typical bedtime, I often continue sitting on the couch for a minute or
two, trying to “work up the energy” to go to bed. This is doubly sad,
because my couch *is* my bed, and if I’m tired enough, I will just
sleep in my clothes.</p>
<section id="baby-steps">
<h2>Baby Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#baby-steps" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Every once in a while through my life, I’d flirt with the idea of
*kaizen*. If you’re not familiar, it’s the concept of starting very
small and using incremental changes to slowly change the world. I’m not
a neuroscientist, and no more than an amateur psychologist, so anything
I say on this is just a personal opinion, but I think it has to do with
flying under my own radar. It doesn’t trip my “why are you expending
effort?” alarm and send me into a sleepy spiral of nested meanings that
sometimes haunt me like barbershop mirrors late at night.</p>
<p>Kaizen became more real for me when I started working with someone who
approached life a little differently. He would say, “Just get started:
Get something going, even if it’s not great. You’ll find yourself
motivated to do more and might even do great work.” He’s quite right.</p>
<p>I began to experience this idea of “start small and build” during a
Saturday yardwork session. It was early spring, and as usual for the
swamp where I live, plants quickly get out of hand before it’s warm and
dry enough to deal with them. Every tool in my arsenal, and a couple in
my neighbor’s shed, were avaialble to me. But where to start?</p>
<p>Then my co-worker’s words came to me. I don’t remember where I started.
I just picked up some random tool and went to find the worst example of
something the tool would fix, and fixed it. After a little while, what
that tool could do seemed eclipsed by a different problem, solved by
some other tool, so I switched.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I had done a *marvelous* job of shaping up the
yard. I was *very* proud of my efforts, and with valid reason. But I
made no plan, created no structure, and prioritized only on the fly as
the day went on.</p>
<p>My co-worker was thrilled a few weeks later, when I showed them that I’d
added their rule to the top of my list of rules, as rule #1.</p>

<section id="linkage">
<h2>Linkage<a class="headerlink" href="#linkage" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Years ago, when I aspired to be a fiction writer, I moved to a new city
to take a technical writing job, leaving my extended family behind. My
brother gifted me a writing guidebook that recommended Hemingway’s
approach to momentum.</p>
<p>It’s called “linkage.” When you’ve reached the limit of either time or
writing flow, stop mid-sentence and leave it in the typewriter. When you
come back tomorrow, says the theory, you will automatically jump in
right where you left off and continue writing.</p>
<p>I think it works for me because I can’t stand to leave things
unfinished. When I step back from a job not fully done, my mind somehow
refuses to erase the context and stores it somewhere for the next time
I’m able to continue the job.</p>
<p>It works for me. Though it may depend on your workstyle and temperament,
I think it’s *at least* worth a try for anyone.</p>
