<h2 id="org840c154">Let me introduce myself</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org840c154">
<p>
I am stormrider. I am a true neutral, creative, diabetic, technical author, and engineer.  Here is how I approach the world.
</p>

<p>
As an engineer and technical author, I am a creator and a knowledge worker.  I strive to do rare and valuable work &#x2013; what Dartmouth professor Cal Newport calls <i>deep work</i>.  Deep work is hard and difficult.  I try my best to choose things that are hard and difficult, choose them often, and sustaining that effort over long periods of time.
</p>

<p>
As a right-brained person in a left-brained world, I use tools to help me transform creativity into engineering results.  I use intuition more than logic, but I don't subscribe to dichotomies, because that is a logical fallacy.  I think in words, pictures, animations, and scenarios.  I am a technical communicator because that's I can do hard and difficult work that produces rare and valuable results.
</p>

<p>
Because of the way my mind works, I choose to use Emacs org-mode as my center of gravity, but I can successfully do the same thing with paper and pencil, if required.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0bae172" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0bae172">Org-mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0bae172">
<p>
Org-mode is a smart outline with folding.  You can easily rearrange the outline with a single key combination.  This helps me capture my mental chaos and organize it into coherent thoughts and plans.
</p>

<p>
Org-mode is also a personal organizer.  I use many of its features, many times every day:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to-do items with user-definable states,</li>
<li>user-assigned priorities,</li>
<li>user-assigned tags,</li>
<li>scheduled dates (with clock time, if desired),</li>
<li>deadlines,</li>
<li>very flexible, user-defined repeat intervals,</li>
<li>and tables that can also function as spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org73bddbe" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org73bddbe">And an agenda</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org73bddbe">
<p>
Org-mode also has an agenda with a flexible viewing interval. From the agenda, I can:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>estimate task effort.</li>
<li>easily change priorities and tags.</li>
<li>move tasks between to-do states.</li>
<li>filter tasks on tags and other attributes,</li>
<li>graphically track my habits,</li>
<li>clock my work,</li>
<li>and many more features.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdba6fae" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgdba6fae">And journaling</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdba6fae">
<p>
I overlay org-journal on top of org-mode, logging events and recording to-do items as they come up, pinned to date and time.  I automatically carry-over undone items to today's journal, so that the agenda doesn't get bogged down with hundreds of files to scan.  And I wrote an emacs lisp function to move repetitive to-do items to a static file that's also visible to the agenda.  
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8287f79" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8287f79">And this website is even built with org-mode</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8287f79">
<p>
Yep, <a href="http://stormrider.io/">stormrider.io</a> is entirely written in org-mode and exported to my server as HTML, on-demand.
