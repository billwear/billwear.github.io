## Getting Things Done (David Allen)

**Translation, not transformation:** externalize intuition into visible next actions — in tolerable chunks.

- **You’re not broken; the environment changed.** Your brain was built for berries and tigers, not Jira and Slack. That’s why you feel scattered — and why there’s a sane way through it.  
- **One pipe for everything.** Stop inventing a new hack for every mess. Work, home, ideas — run it all through a single, trusted flow, and the chaos starts organizing itself.  
- **Make your imagination work on command.** You already “see” finished things in your head. This turns that daydream into a repeatable sequence you can start anytime.  
- **Build a cockpit, not a shrine.** A clean surface, one capture tool, lists you trust, and a small standing time slot. It’s wiring the instruments so takeoff is calm.  
- **Free your RAM.** The relief isn’t from finishing everything—it’s from parking everything where you know you’ll come back to it.  
- **Decide, don’t stash.** Stress is mostly “undecided stuff.” Clear the intake and the windshield clears with it.  
- **Clear buckets kill hesitation.** When everything has a home, your brain stops asking “where does this go?” and starts moving.  
- **Keep lists alive with a reset.** Without a simple weekly sweep, lists turn into zombies. A quick reset brings the map back to the territory.  
- **Match action to the moment.** No more guilt about “big rocks” at 10 pm. Use a simple filter to pick what fits the slot you’re in.  
- **Name the next move and watch the fog lift.** “Fix the docs” is quicksand. “Open the draft and outline sections” is traction.  
- **Capture it all or second-guess it all.** Trust shows up when every stray thought—from cat litter to launch plan—lands in the same net.  
- **Work toward a finish line, not a feeling.** “Router reset and online, lights stable” beats “work on router.” A clear end state turns drudgery into progress.

## Atomic Habits (James Clear)

Tiny moves, compounding over time. Identity first, outcomes second. Build an environment that makes the right thing the easy thing—and let consistency do the heavy lifting.

- **Win by 1%—repeated.** You don’t need heroics; you need small, repeatable moves that compound into something huge.  
- **Change your identity, not just your checklist.** Don’t “finish a rewrite”—be the kind of writer who shows up.  
- **See the loop, then shape it.** Every habit runs cue → craving → response → reward. Once you notice the wiring, you can edit it.  
- **Spot the trigger.** Most slips are autopilot. Name the cue (time, place, mood, people) and you stop flying blind.  
- **Attach the new to the known.** “After X, I do Y.” Habit stacking and tiny intentions make starts frictionless.  
- **Let the room do the work.** Good cues obvious, bad cues invisible. Design spaces that steer you without effort.  
- **Real self-control is setup.** Remove temptations upfront so you don’t need midnight willpower.  
- **Make it feel good now.** Pair habits with immediate rewards and small wins—motivation loves quick feedback.  
- **Borrow a better normal.** Join tribes where your target behavior is standard; culture pulls you forward.  
- **Debug the need, not just the habit.** Every “bad” habit solves a problem. Keep the reward, swap in a better response.  
- **Show up beats speed.** Never miss twice. Traction comes from consistency, not perfect days.  
- **Bend the path of least resistance.** Lower friction for good habits, raise it for bad ones; convenience wins every time.  
- **Start in two minutes.** Shrink entry points until starting is effortless—momentum will take it from there.  
- **Automate your better self.** Commit devices, reminders, filters—install guardrails so the system helps you behave.  
- **Track what you treasure.** Streaks and visible progress keep habits alive; your brain craves proof.  
- **Play where you have leverage.** Aim habits at your natural strengths so discipline gets a tailwind.  
- **Live in the Goldilocks zone.** Keep challenges “stretch but doable.” Too easy bores you; too hard breaks you.  
- **Refactor routines before they fossilize.** Habits are a foundation, not a prison—review and refresh to keep growing.

## Deep Work (Cal Newport)

Quiet intensity on purpose. Depth is rare and valuable—so you schedule it, defend it, and turn it into visible artifacts while the shallow stuff lives on a budget.

- **Depth is your leverage.** In a noisy economy, focus is a competitive edge most people never train.  
- **Focus doesn’t “show up”—you schedule it.** If it isn’t on the calendar, shallow wins by default.  
- **One target per block.** Pick a single outcome for the session, remove friction, and start.  
- **Choose a style that fits your life.** Retreats, weekly chunks, daily rhythms, or seize-the-moment sprints—the point is consistency.  
- **Train boredom tolerance.** The urge to switch is the muscle to train; resisting it is a rep toward deeper focus.  
- **Be ruthless about inputs.** Keep tools and feeds that earn their keep; quit the ones that don’t pay rent in results.  
- **Drain the shallows.** Batch low-value tasks and time-box them.  
- **Rituals are your runway.** Start cues and a shutdown ritual protect attention.  
- **Ship proof, not vibes.** End each block with an artifact—draft, commit, diagram—so progress is tangible.  
- **Defend your fortress politely.** Use status messages and norms so people know when you’re heads-down.  
- **Make depth the default meaning.** Shallow work is necessary; deep work is satisfying.

## Thinking, Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)

Two minds share your steering wheel: a fast, fluent autopilot and a slow, effortful pilot. Learn to spot shortcuts, catch traps, and route high-stakes calls through the right system.

- **Catch your autopilot.** Most errors start in fast mode; notice it, invite deliberate mode when it matters.  
- **Budget attention like fuel.** Thinking hard burns energy; save it for complex work.  
- **Fluent ≠ true.** If it feels smooth and obvious, double-check.  
- **Ask the right question.** Don’t let your brain substitute an easier one.  
- **Break the anchor.** First numbers drag judgment; reset before deciding.  
- **Vivid ≠ likely.** Stories distort risk; use data.  
- **Use base rates, not vibes.** Probabilities beat prototypes.  
- **Don’t fall for the “and.”** The appealing combo is often less probable than the plain fact.  
- **Expect regression.** Hot streaks cool and slumps rebound.  
- **Forecast humbly.** Prefer ranges and updates.  
- **Design for loss aversion.** Frame gains as avoided losses too.  
- **Beware endowment.** Ownership inflates value.  
- **Make policies, not one-offs.** Simple rules beat ad-hoc choices.  
- **Mind the frame.** Rephrase until math, not wording, drives you.  
- **Serve both selves.** Plan for living well and remembering well.  
- **Chase attention, not just income.** Presence boosts happiness more than dollars.

*If this resonates, [buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/).*

## The One Thing (Gary Keller)

Find the lever that moves the week. Ask a better daily question, line up your dominoes, and protect the block that makes everything else easier—or unnecessary.

- **Find the lever, not the pile.** You need the one action that tilts the system.  
- **Ask a better question daily.** “What’s the one thing I can do…?”—then answer it.  
- **Make a success list, not a to-do list.** Keep the few that move the needle.  
- **Time-block the crown jewel.** Put your One Thing on the calendar first.  
- **Domino your work.** Start small; momentum beats motivation.  
- **Say “no” to serve the big “yes.”** Decline by default, opt-in with intent.  
- **Goal-set to now.** Work backward from someday to today.  
- **Protect the block.** Status on, door closed, notifications off.  
- **Measure by results.** Busy ≠ progress.  
- **Expect some chaos.** Let it wobble.  
- **Engineer your environment.** Let space nudge you toward focus.  
- **Energy is prerequisite.** Sleep, food, movement power the block.  
- **Make it visible.** Keep the One Thing where you’ll see it.  
- **One block, every day.** Consistency wins.  
- **Extraordinary is sequential, not simultaneous.**

*If this hits home, [buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776/).*

## Essentialism (Greg McKeown)

Do less, better. Trade noise for clarity, prune by design, and give your best work your best hours.

- **Choose on purpose.** Essentialism is deliberate yes and graceful no.  
- **Say no to the good to protect the great.** If it isn’t a near-10/10, it’s a no.  
- **Make space to think.** Clarity requires quiet.  
- **Name your Essential Intent.** A clear “why/what” simplifies every choice.  
- **Edit your life like a pro.** Cut scenes, not lines.  
- **Trade-offs are strategy.** Own the math and move forward.  
- **Design default “no.”** Templates and boundaries save time.  
- **Protect the asset.** Energy fuels quality.  
- **Buffer for reality.** Add slack to plans.  
- **One decision, many actions.** Rules replace willpower.  
- **Remove the obstacle.** Make essential paths easy, others awkward.  
- **Schedule essentials first.** Guard prime hours.  
- **Small wins, visible progress.** Momentum beats volume.  
- **Stand firm, kindly.** Clear no = self-respect.  
- **Live it, don’t perform it.** Less, but better.

*If this resonates, [buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382/).*

## Behave (Robert Sapolsky)

Behavior isn’t a moment—it’s a stack of moments. Milliseconds of neural spikes, minutes of hormones, days of context, years of development, and millennia of evolution—all pushing on the same lever.

- **Think in time layers.** What you do now was biased seconds, hours, and years ago.  
- **State beats story.** Physiology tilts perception before thought.  
- **Use your brake pedal.** Pause, breathe, label, regain control.  
- **Design the baseline.** Sleep, food, movement, sunlight.  
- **Yesterday leaks into today.** Plan high-stakes work after recovery.  
- **Adolescence is biology.** Coach the brake, not just the gas.  
- **Early life sets thresholds.** The dials aren’t at zero.  
- **Genes are levers, not scripts.** Setup ≠ fate.  
- **Culture writes on biology.** Choose tribes that fit who you’re becoming.  
- **Regulate before you reason.** Downshift first.  
- **Name it to tame it.** Label feelings to loosen grip.  
- **Engineer anti-triggers.** Environment beats restraint.  
- **Swap the reward, keep the need.** Replace bad responses, not needs.  
- **Lead with framing.** Present for shared goals, not threats.  
- **Justice needs context.** Design systems that prevent harm.  
- **Op-amp mindset.** Adjust gain and feedback; outputs improve.

*If this hits, [buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/Behave-Biology-Humans-Best-Worst/dp/1594205078/).*

- **Swap, don’t suffer.** Butter→olive oil; red meat→fish; dessert→fruit.  
- **Let your kitchen set the defaults.** Stock smart staples.  
- **Flavor over rules.** Herbs, citrus, garlic, spices.  
- **Portable, not precious.** It’s a pattern, not a passport.  
- **Make plants the base layer.** Add fish, poultry, eggs a few times a week.  
- **“Sometimes” foods stay special.** Treats occasional.  
- **Optional wine, never random.** Ritual, not impulse.

- **Cook simple, cook often.** Five-ingredient staples beat takeout.  
- **Plan once, glide all week.** Simple list, loose plan.  
- **Environment beats willpower.** Keep fruit visible, hide junk.  
- **Backed by decades, not hype.** Proven pattern.
