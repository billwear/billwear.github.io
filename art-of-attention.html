<p>There comes a moment in life, often in
      the quietest of hours, when one realizes
      that the world will continue on its
      wayward course, indifferent to our              desires or frustrations. And it is then,
      perhaps, that a subtle truth begins to
      emerge: the only thing we truly possess,
      the only thing we might, with enough
      care, exert some mastery over, is our
      mind. It is not a realization of
      resignation, but rather of liberation.
      For if the mind can be ordered, if it           can be made still in the midst of this
      restless life, then we have already
      discovered the key to a deeper kind of
      freedom.</p>

<p>But how does one begin? It is not with
      grand declarations or bold, sweeping
      changes. That would miss the point
      entirely. Rather, it is with a gentle
      attention to the present, a deliberate
      shift in the way we move through the
      world. We begin by paying attention to
      what our mind doesâ€”its wanderings, its
      anxieties, its compulsions. It is a
      garden untended, overgrown with concerns
      that may not even be our own. And the
      first step is simply to watch, to
      observe how the mind moves, without
      judgment, without rush.</p>
