Translation:

* **GE** Geek of Engineering.
* **d-** I'm usually in jeans and a t-shirt.
* **s:++** I'm of average height, I'm a linebacker candidate.
* **a+++** age 60 and up (65 atm).
* **C++++** I'll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface installed into my skull.
* **UL50** I've been using Unix for 50 years (on Jun 14, 2024).
* **P+++** I've earned a living with Perl.
* **L(U)+++** I use Ubuntu Linux exclusively, mostly command line.
* **E+++** Emacs is my login shell!! M-x doctor is my psychologist! I use emacs to control my TV and toaster oven! All you vi people don't know what you're missing! I read alt.religion.emacs, alt.sex.emacs, and comp.os.emacs.
* **W1.0+++** I am an original Netizen, first logging on in 1994.
* **N+++** I read so many newsgroups that the next batch of news comes in before I finish reading the last batch, and I have to read for about 2 hours straight before I'm caught up on the morning's news. Then there's the afternoon.
* **K+** I like Kibo. If you know, you know.
* **w---** Windows is bloatware.
* **V** I've used VMS. Meh.
* **PS+** My whole concept of politics? Nobody has the right to legislate morality.
* **PE** Distrust both government and business.
* **f---** In matters of religion, I distrust all human claims for the one true way.
* **c+++** I am a cyberpunk all the way, including music.
* **Y+** I have an interest and concern in privacy issues, but in reality I am not really all that active or vocal.
* **PGP++** I have the most recent version and use it regularly.
* **t+++** Star Trek inspires me. I wonder about about warp field dynamics and the principles behind the transporter. I have owned the TECH manual and the LP record. I speak some Klingon. I wear an IDIC. I still hate the LCARS interface, though: incredibly noisy, and it really sucks.
* **5** Babylon 5 is sub-par.
* **X-** It's ok if you like paranoia and conspiracy stories. I don't.
* **R+++** I've built and run my own dungeons for money. Lots of money. At comic-cons. With 100 little envelopes of dice I brought with me.
* **tv---** Not much on TV anymore, though I sometimes watch it when I'm petting the cat.
* **b++** I find the time to get through at least one new book a month.
* **D---** Dilbert doesn't speak to me; I've tried to stay out of those type situations.
* **xkcd** I check out xkcd from time to time; sometimes it's really funny.
* **G** I know what the geek code is and even did up this code.
* **e++++** I am well-educated, mostly by myself, but I did get more than one college degree.
* **h+++** I live in the swampy woods, on land I own, in a house I own outright, and try to live as self-sufficiently as possible.
* **r+++** I found my angel, and we've been married for decades now.
