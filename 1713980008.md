**You are a bundle of energy, always on the go.**

spent lunch getting a little better control of my budget; still relying on credit cards to buffer, but getting better.  didn't realize how much i was using them until i started having a house note; now i'm on a mission to clear them out and leave them for actual credit card things, instead of daily expenses.
