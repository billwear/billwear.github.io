**You are a bundle of energy, always on the go.**

spent lunch getting a little better control of my budget; still relying on credit cards to buffer, but getting better.  didn't realize how much i was using them until i started having a house note; now i'm on a mission to clear them out and leave them for actual credit card things, instead of daily expenses.

* 12:43 back to work-ish
i'm working on explaining how my open-source product interacts with dhcp; it brings its own dhcpd with it, and there are configuration parameters and the like; the people who coded it are long-gone from the project, and users want to know. meh; work to do.
